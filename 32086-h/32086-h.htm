<p class="noind">In this book I endeavour to present, with whatever skill
of penmanship I may possess, my father&rsquo;s impressions
of Japan. I trust that they will not lose in force and
vigour in that they are closely intermingled with my own
impressions, which were none the less vivid because they
were those of a child,&mdash;for it was as a child, keenly
interested in and enjoying all I saw, that I passed,
four or five years ago, through that lovely flower-land
of the Far East, which my father has here so charmingly
memorialised in colour.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>ART AND THE DRAMA</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I always</span> agree with that man who said, &ldquo;Let me
make the nation&rsquo;s songs and I care not who frames her
laws,&rdquo; or words to that effect, for, in my opinion, nothing
so well indicates national character or so keenly accentuates
the difference between individuals and nations
as the way in which they spend their leisure hours;
and the theatres of Japan are thoroughly typical of the
people&rsquo;s character. It would be utterly impossible for
the Japanese to keep art out of their lives. It creeps into
everything, and is as the very air they breathe. Art with
them is not only a conscious effort to achieve the beautiful,
but also an instinctive expression of inherited taste.
It beautifies their homes and pervades their gardens;
and perhaps one never realises this all-dominating power
more fully than when in a Japanese theatre, which is,
invariably, a veritable temple of art. But here with us
in the West it is different. We have no art, and our
methods merely lead us to deception, while we do not
begin to understand those few great truths which form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
the basis of oriental philosophy, and without which perfection
in the dramatic art is impossible. For example,
the philosophy of balance, of which the Japanese are
past masters, is to us unknown. The fact that Nature
is commonplace, thereby forming a background, as it
were, for Tragedy and the spirit of life to work, has
never occurred to us; while the background of our
Western play is not by any means a plan created by a
true artist upon which to display the dramatic picture
as it is in Japan, but simply a background to advertise
the stage-manager&rsquo;s imitative talent. The result is, of
course, that the acting and the environment are at
variance instead of being in harmonic unity. But we
in the West have not time to think of vague things,
such as balance and breadth and the creating of pictures.
What we want is realism; we want a sky to look like a
real sky, and the moon in it to look like a real moon,
even if it travels by clock-work, as it has been known to
do occasionally. And so real is this clock-work moon
that we are deceived into imagining that it is the moon,
the actual moon. But the deception is not pleasant; in
fact, it almost gives you indigestion to see a moon, and
such a moon, careering over the whole sky in half an
hour. In Japan they would not occupy themselves with
making you believe that a moon on the stage was a real
one&mdash;they would consider such false realism as a bit of
gross degradation&mdash;but they would take the greatest
possible pains as to the proper placing of that palpably
pasteboard moon of theirs, even if they had to hold it
up in the sky by the aid of a broom-stick.</p>

<p class="caption">WATCHING THE PLAY</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span></p>

<p>In Japan the scenic work of a play is handled by
one man alone, and that man is the dramatic author,
who is almost invariably a great artist. To him the
stage is a huge canvas upon which he is to paint his
picture, and of which each actor forms a component
part. This picture of his has to be thought out in every
detail; he has to think of his figures in relation to his
background, just as a Japanese architect when building
a house or a temple takes into consideration the surrounding
scenery, and even the trees and the hills, in
order to form a complete picture, perfect in balance and
in form. When a dramatic author places his drama
upon the stage, he arranges the colour and setting of
it in obedience to his ideas of fitness, which are partly
intuitive and partly traditional. It is probably necessary
that his background should be a monotone, or arranged
in broad masses of colour, in order to balance the
brilliancy of the action, and against which the moving
figures are sharply defined. And it is only in Japan
that you see such brilliant luminous effects on the stage,
for the Japs alone seem to have the courage to handle
very vivid colours in a masterly way&mdash;glorious sweeps
of gold and of blue&mdash;vivid, positive colour. No low-toned
plush curtains and what we call rich, sombre
colour, with overdressed, shifted-calved flunkeys, stepping
silently about on velvet carpets, shod in list slippers,
and looking for all the world like a lot of burglars,
only needing a couple of dark lanterns to complete their
stealthy appearance.</p>

<p>Then, there are no Morris-papered anterooms and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
corridors in Japan, as we have here&mdash;sad bottlegreens
and browns leading to a stage that is still sadder in
colour&mdash;only a sadness lit up by a fierce glare of
electric light.</p>

<p>The true artistic spirit is wanting in the West. We
are too timid to deal in masses for effect, and we have
such a craving for realism that we become simply
technical imitators like the counterfeiters of banknotes.
Our great and all-prevailing idea is to cram as much
of what we call realism and detail into a scene as
possible; the richer the company, and the more money
they have to handle, the more hopeless the work
becomes, for the degradation of it is still more forcibly
emphasised. Consequently, we always create spotty
pictures; in fact, one rarely ever sees a well-balanced
scene in a Western theatre, and simply because we do
not realise the breadth and simplicity of Nature. There
are not the violent contrasts in Nature that our artists
are so continually depicting: Nature plays well within
her range, and you seldom see her going to extremes.
In a sunlit garden the deepest shadow and the brightest
light come very near together, so broad and so subtle
are her harmonies. We do not realise this, and we
sacrifice breadth in the vain endeavour to gain what we
propose to call strength&mdash;strength is sharp; but breadth
is quiet and full of reserve. None understands this
simple truth so well as the Japanese. It forms the very
basis of oriental philosophy, and through the true perception
of it they have attained to those ideas of balance
which are so eminent a characteristic of Japanese art.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:495px" src="images/img26.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE BILL OF THE PLAY</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span></p>

<p>When you have balanced force you have reached
perfection, and this is of course the true criterion of
dramatic art. But here in the West we must be
realistic, and if a manager succeeds in producing upon
the stage an exact representation of a room in Belgrave
Square he is perfectly content, and looks upon his work
as a triumph. There is to be no choice: he does not
choose his room from the decorative standpoint&mdash;such
a thing would never occur to him for a moment&mdash;but
simply grabs at this particular room that he happens to
know in Belgrave Square, nicknacks and all, and plants
it upon the stage. His wife, he imagines, has a taste
for dress, and she dresses the people that are to sit about
in this room, probably playing a game of &ldquo;Bridge,&rdquo;
just as you might see it played any day in Belgrave
Square. I remember once, when a play of this nature
was being acted at one of our leading theatres, hearing a
disgusted exclamation from a man at my side&mdash;&ldquo;Well!
if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;we might go and see a
game of Bridge played any night&rdquo;; and it occurred
to me as I heard him that the managers will suffer for
this foolish realism, the public will soon tire of it, for
they, almost unconsciously, want something altogether
bigger and finer&mdash;let us hope they want art.</p>

<p>The Japanese are not led away by this struggle to
be realistic, and this is one of the chief reasons why the
stage of Japan is so far ahead of our stage. If a horse
is introduced into a scene he will be by no means a real
horse, but a very wooden one, with wooden joints, just
like a nursery rocking-horse; yet this decorative animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
will be certain to take its proper place in the composition
of the picture. But when realism has its artistic
value, the Japs will use it to the full. If a scene
is to be the interior of a house, it will be an interior,
complete in every detail down to the exquisite bowl of
flowers which almost invariably forms the chief decoration
of a Japanese room. But suppose they want a
garden: they do not proceed, as we do, to take one
special garden and copy it literally; that garden has to
be created and thought out to form a perfect whole;
even the lines of the tiny trees and the shape of the hills
in the distance have to be considered in relation to the
figures of the actors who are to tell their story there.
This is true art. Then, when you go to a theatre in
Japan, you are made to feel that you are actually living
in the atmosphere of the play: the body of the theatre
and the stage are linked together, and the spectator
feels that he is contained in the picture itself, that he is
looking on at a scene which is taking place in real life
just before his very eyes. And it is the great aim of
every ambitious dramatic author to make you feel this.
To gain this end, if the scene is situated by the seashore,
he will cause the sea, which is represented by that
decorative design called the wave pattern, to be swept
right round the theatre, embracing both audience and
stage and dragging you into the very heart of his
picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:497px" src="images/img30.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A GARDEN</p></div>

<p>For this same reason, a Japanese theatre is always
built with two broad passages, called Hanamichi (or
flower-paths), leading through the audience to the stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
up which you can watch a Daimio and his gorgeous
retinue sweep on his royal way to visit perhaps another
Daimio whose house is represented on the stage. This is
very dramatic, and greatly forwards the author&rsquo;s scheme
of bringing you into touch with the stage. But we in
our Western theatres need not trouble ourselves with
all this, for we frame our scenes in a vulgar gilt frame;
we hem them in and cut them off from the rest of the
house. When we go to a theatre here, we go to view
a picture hung up on a wall, and generally a very foolish
inartistic picture it is too. And even taking our stage
from the point of view of a picture, it is wrong, for in
a work of art the frame should never have an independent
value as an achievement, but be subordinate to,
and part of, the whole. All idea of framing the stage
must be done away with; else we are in danger of
going to the other extreme, as some artists have done,
and cause our picture to overlap and spread itself upon
the frame. An artist in a realistic mood has been
known, when painting a picture of the seaside, to so
crave after texture as to sprinkle sand upon the foreground,
and becoming more and more enthusiastic
he has at last ended in an exuberance of realism by
clapping some real shells on to the frame and gilding
them over. Thus the picture appeared to pour out
on to its frame. This is all very terrible and inartistic;
yet it is but an instance of the kind of mistake that we
let ourselves in for by the ridiculous method of stage-setting
which we practise.</p>

<p>Now, built as the Japanese theatres are, with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
flower-paths leading from the stage, there is no fear of
such a disaster; yet Westerners, who have never been
to Japan, on hearing of the construction of a Japanese
theatre, are rather inclined to conjure up to their fancies
visions of the low comedian who springs through trap-doors,
and of the clown who leaves the ring of the
circus to seat himself between two maiden ladies in the
audience; but if these people were to go to Japan and
see a really fine production at a properly conducted
theatre, such an idea would never occur to them
at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:487px; height:630px" src="images/img34.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ROAD TO THE TEMPLE</p></div>

<p>Here and there, however, the unthinking globe-trotter,
with more or less the vulgar mind, will be inclined
to laugh as he sees a richly-clothed actor sweep
majestically through the audience to the stage; he will
point out the prompter who never attempts to conceal
himself, and the little black-robed supers who career
about the stage arranging dresses, slipping stools under
actors, and bearing away any little article that they
don&rsquo;t happen to want. &ldquo;How funny and elementary
it all is!&rdquo; they will remark; but there is nothing
elementary about it at all; these little supers who appear
to them so amusing are perfect little artists, and are
absolutely necessary to ensure the success of a scene.
Suppose Danjuro, the greatest actor in Japan, appears
upon the stage dressed in a most gorgeous costume,
and takes up a position before a screen which he will
probably have to retain for half an hour: these little
people must be there to see that the sweep of his dress
is correct in relation to the lines of the screen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
placing of this drapery is elaborately rehearsed by the
supers, and when they step back from their work even
the globe-trotter is bound to admit that the picture
created by Danjuro and the screen is a perfectly beautiful
one, and a picture which could not have been brought
about by merely walking up and stopping short, or by
the backward kick that a leading lady gives to her skirt.
These little supers may go, come, and drift about on
the stage; they may slip props under the actors and
illuminate their faces with torches; yet the refined
Japanese gentleman (and he is always an artist) is
utterly unconscious of their presence. They are dressed
in black: therefore it would be considered as the height
of vulgarity in him to see them. Indeed, the audience
are in honour bound not to notice these people, and it
would be deemed in their eyes just as vulgar for
you to point out a super in the act of arranging a
bit of drapery, as to enter a temple and smell the
incense there. No Japanese ever smells incense: he is
merely conscious of it. Incense is full of divine and
beautiful suggestion; but the moment you begin to
vulgarise it by talking, or even thinking, of its smell,
all beauty and significance is destroyed.</p>

<p>Everything connected with the stage in Japan is
reduced to a fine art: the actor&rsquo;s walk&mdash;the dignity of
it!&mdash;you would never see a man walk in the street as
he would on the stage. And then the tone of voice,
bearing, and attitude&mdash;everything about the man is
changed. I remember once in Tokio being introduced
to the manager of a local theatre, whose performance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
so much pleased me that I begged the privilege of
making a few studies before the play began, hinting
at the same time that I should very much like one or
two of the actors to pose for me. Then this little
gentleman began to think and frown and pucker his
brow, secretly proud that an artist should want to paint
his work, and also not unwilling to make a little money.
At last, after much deliberation, he decided that I was
to have the run of his theatre and ten actors for the
afternoon, charging three dollars and a half for the
whole concern. This seemed to me to be fairly reasonable;
I did not know of any London theatre that I
could have hired for three dollars and a half, or even as
many pounds, and then the company consisted of ten
actors who were all artists, all loving their work as only
true artists can. To be sure, it was a suburban theatre,
and the acting was not of the finest; probably also
there was a great deal of exaggeration in the poses;
but still it lent itself to decorative work, and answered
my purpose to perfection. They did not act, but
merely posed to form a series of pictures, and some
of the expressions of the actors were extraordinarily
grotesque, just like a Japanese picture-book. But
what struck me most of all was the absolute autocracy
of the little manager, or whatever he called himself&mdash;the
Czar of Russia or General Booth was not in it
with him for power! He threw his actors about
on the stage just as an artist would fling pigment
on to a canvas; and his violent whisking of a bit of
vermilion and apple-green in against a wave was too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
dexterous and masterly for anything, and called forth
my unfeigned admiration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:491px; height:630px" src="images/img38.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE STREET WITH THE GALLERY</p></div>

<p>The greatest living actor at the present moment in
Japan is Danjuro&mdash;in fact, I should say that he is one
of the greatest actors in the whole world; and in order
to give a true insight into the many beauties of the
Japanese drama, it seems to me that I cannot do better
than describe a day that I once spent with this great
master.</p>

<p>I was taken to see him by Fukuchi, Japan&rsquo;s
most eminent dramatist and the greatest of living
writers. We were shown into a small room with
spotless mats to await Danjuro&rsquo;s arrival, and my
attention was at once attracted towards an exquisite
kakemono that hung on the wall, which was the only
decoration the room possessed. It was a picture, a
masterpiece, that seemed to suggest one of the early
Italian masters; it impressed me tremendously, and I
told Fukuchi so. &ldquo;Ah, I am glad!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;for Danjuro, the great master, when I told him
you were coming and that you were a painter, asked
me many questions about you. He took much pains
to discover the quality of art that appealed to you,
and the side of Nature that you liked the best. He
also wished to know your favourite flower, and which
kind of blossom you loved the most&mdash;whether you
preferred, as he did, the single cherry-blossom, or
the double. This Danjuro was unable to find out;
if he had known he would have chosen a kakemono
of flowers for you. But I am glad you like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
picture.&rdquo; I was amazed at the kindness of this man
Danjuro. There was no accident about this picture
that I admired so vastly: it had been chosen for a
definite reason&mdash;to give me pleasure. And I afterwards
learnt that there is no end to the amount of trouble a
Japanese gentleman will take in the choosing of the
picture that is to hang in the room where you are
being entertained.</p>

<p>When you enter a house in Japan, the first and one
idea is to give you pleasure, and the people of the
house will take elaborate pains, almost the care that
a detective will take in detecting a crime, to find out,
as delicately as possible, your taste in regard to this
picture. They will send their servant round to your
hotel to find out what flower you have expressly asked
to have placed on your table, and that will be the
flower that you will find adorning either a kakemono
or a vase when entering the house of your friend.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:500px" src="images/img42.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SUN AND LANTERNS</p></div>

<p>This room where Fukuchi and I were waiting
looked out upon the garden&mdash;a miniature garden, no
bigger than an ordinary dining-room, yet perfectly
balanced, one that held infinite joys: there were
the miniature bridges, lakes, and gold-fish, the
mountains, the valleys, and the ancient turtles&mdash;all
correct as to colour and marked by that exquisite
taste which only a Japanese landscape-gardener can
display. It was a bright sunlit day, and looking
from this room with its perfect masterpiece to the
little jewel of a garden, you felt that you were living
in another world. And it was all so pure and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
&ldquo;right&rdquo; that I began to feel hopelessly &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo;
It seemed that I was the only blot in these perfect
surroundings. And at last I became so shy that I
really didn&rsquo;t know what to do with myself, and I
felt that the only thing left for me was to take off my
clothes and dig a hole in the ground, and then be
ashamed that I had left my clothes behind me. However,
I controlled my emotions and waited on with
Fukuchi until the sliding doors dividing us from
the adjoining room were quietly opened and Danjuro
appeared. So unlike an actor!&mdash;no moving
of the eyebrows, no stroking of the hair, but just a
simple dignified gentleman, and an old gentleman,
quite old. He was a slim, spare man, very refined,
with the look of a picture of Buddha by Botticelli.
The face was thin and narrow and keen; bright eyes
glanced at me from under heavy eyebrows; his manner
was magnetic; and I felt at once that he was a great
artist. The way his servants saluted him! You could
see that they loved him, and yet by the reverence they
showed him he might have been a cardinal. I was at
once offered exquisite delicacies in little lacquer cups,
and we all sat down, on the floor of course, and
Danjuro began to talk. One of the first things he
said to me, through Fukuchi, who spoke English
perfectly, was, &ldquo;I am told that I have many qualities
like your great actor Sir Henry Irving,&rdquo; and even as
he spoke I could trace a distinct facial likeness between
the two men. His voice was rich and powerful and
his enunciation deliberate; he used his hands quietly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
and the expression varied very little except when
he was anxious to emphasise, and then the change
was extraordinary, while the expression and poses were
so admirable that I could almost understand what the
man was saying.</p>

<p>I instinctively felt that the right thing to do was to
first talk of the kakemono, and Danjuro, seeing my
genuine enthusiasm, smiled and said, without a touch
of false modesty, &ldquo;Yes; it is a great masterpiece!&rdquo;
and then he began to tell me about this picture, and I
felt at once that this dignified little gentleman was a
true artist.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:491px" src="images/img46.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SUMMER AFTERNOON</p></div>

<p>From the picture we drifted to the Drama, and
Danjuro was very curious to know something of our
work in London, and now and then, as he plied me
with pertinent questions, I thought I detected a glimmer
of fun behind his inscrutable demeanour. At last
the questions rained around me so rapidly, and were
so terribly to the point, that I felt thoroughly ashamed
and did not know how to answer him. I knew that
he was an artist, looking at his work from purely
the artistic standpoint, and as an artist I knew that
it would be utterly impossible for him to appreciate
our Western methods: so I deftly turned the conversation
by returning the fire of questions. I had seen
Danjuro in one or two scenes in which I was greatly
struck with the remarkable changes of his facial
expression. There was one scene in which Danjuro
faced the audience, and in a minute, by the complete
alteration of his face, changed himself into an entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
different man. This feat was really so remarkable
that I was anxious to know how it was done, and
suggested that it might have been accomplished by
a clever make-up. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is
a rule of mine to use &lsquo;make-up&rsquo; very rarely. For
change of expression we actors have to depend much
on the muscles of our faces&rdquo;; and Danjuro, to
illustrate this, quickly changed his face until it was
totally different, even to the face markings, and I
should have defied Sherlock Holmes himself to have
known him to be the same man. Then I saw him
act the part of a drunken man. I have seen drunken
men on the stage over and over again, and there has
always been a touch of vulgarity about them; but this
drunken man of Danjuro&rsquo;s was an exquisite triumph of
art. I was curious to know how he had perfected this
rôle, and suggested that it had perhaps been brought
about through a careful study of the habits and actions
of a drunkard, using him as a model, as it were. But
this Danjuro firmly denied. &ldquo;No, no, never!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I might just as well take a drunken man and
stick him on the stage, just as he is, as to imitate any
one man. That is not art: it is not a creation. I have
seen drunken men all my life, and the drunken man
I represented was the aggregate of all the drunkenness
I have ever seen. Suppose by chance I had come
across a drunken man while I was developing the
character, I should perhaps have been tempted to
follow that particular man too closely, and the result
would have been necessarily inartistic.&rdquo; And Danjuro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
made it quite clear to me that when creating the
character of either a drunken man or a madman,
he invariably keeps as far away from Nature as possible.
He would not proceed as some of our actors do, to
hunt about in the slums until he had found a man
sufficiently drunk for his purpose, and then copy him
exactly; or, yet again, he would not have attempted
to imitate a death-bed scene by watching one particular
person die. Such a thing would appear to him as a
great degradation.</p>

<p>Almost imperceptibly the conversation swerved round
again to English acting, and Danjuro gave me a rather
humorous, though humiliating, description of a play he
had seen in Yokohama. The language was gibberish
to him, and all he could do was to study the poses of
the players, which struck him as being extremely awkward.
&ldquo;They suggested to me badly modelled statues,&rdquo;
he explained; &ldquo;they never seemed to move gracefully,
and their actions were always violent and exaggerated.&rdquo;
This, from a Japanese, was frank criticism, for he made
it quite clear to me that he had little or no sympathy
with our methods. He felt that he was talking to
an artist and that he could afford to be natural; but
after this very candid opinion there was a slight pause,
which I hastened to break by putting a question on
the subject of his own drama.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:500px; height:630px" src="images/img50.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">APRICOT-BLOSSOM STREET</p></div>

<p>The drama of Japan, he told me, was greatly improving;
the actors nowadays have chances which in
the early days they had not, and it is easier for them
to create fine scenic effects. They have the chance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
studying great masterpieces at museums; they may
copy costumes there, and, above all, they have the
superb opportunity of studying colour and form.
Then, many of the great Japanese actors possess collections
of very fine pictures, while the actors of early
times could only study from badly printed woodblocks
which were nearly all inaccurate. Schools for actors
have been occupying his attention, and he hopes that
some day they will be established all over Japan.
Actors, in his opinion, should be taught when they
are quite young the science of deportment and of
graceful movement, to be artists as well as actors, and
above all to avoid exaggeration.</p>

<p>Danjuro prefers as an audience the middle classes.
&ldquo;They are more sympathetic,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the diplomats
and politicians who have come in touch with the
West, and are dressed in European dress, seem somehow
to lose sympathy with us, and are not helpful
as an audience. Perhaps it is that they can never
entirely divest themselves of the sense of their own
importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After considering Danjuro&rsquo;s views concerning the
Japanese drama, I was interested to hear the views
of the dramatic author, and Fukuchi and I spent
many delightful afternoons together discussing this all-absorbing
topic. &ldquo;What do you claim to be the chief
advantages of Japanese as compared with European
theatres?&rdquo; I asked him on one occasion. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
replied Fukuchi without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;before
everything else I should place the Hanamichi (flower-paths).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
This is absolutely indispensable to the Japanese
stage, and allows of endless possibilities. With it we
have far greater scope for fine work, and dramatically it
is of tremendous advantage. Then there is the revolving
stage, which is a great improvement on Western
mechanism, for while one scene is being acted, another
can be prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon the dramatist and I
were sitting in Mr. Fukuchi&rsquo;s own room overlooking
the river with a distant view of the sea. Books, all
Japanese, were heaped up in an alcove, while the only
furniture the room possessed was a very fine kakemono
and a little narrow table. While we were talking, one
of Fukuchi&rsquo;s little children, a boy of eight, entered,
carrying with him his collection of butterflies, which,
he thought, might chance to interest me. He
showed me a catalogue which he was preparing for
them. It was so admirably compiled that it would
have been good enough for a special work on the
subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:493px; height:630px" src="images/img54.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OUTSIDE KIOTO</p></div>

<p>Fukuchi&rsquo;s ideal actor is Danjuro, and during the
conversation he was constantly referring to him. &ldquo;Of
all the actors I like Danjuro the best,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
he is an artist and understands colour, besides having
a keen appreciation for harmony in the general arrangements.&rdquo;
He told me that Danjuro is the one actor in
Japan who can take the part of a woman to perfection.
Many actors on the stage can keep the figure of a
woman for five minutes at a time, but rarely longer,
so painful are the poses, owing to the throwing back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
of the shoulders and the turning in of the knees. But
Danjuro can go on and on indefinitely in this rôle, and
so remarkable is he that even a Japanese woman is
unable to detect one false move. On one occasion,
when taking this part at a theatre in Yokohama before
an audience composed chiefly of women, he happened
to make a slip and by some slight error proved himself
the man. In an instant the whole audience felt it,
and the effect produced on them was simply astounding!
For once they nearly laughed, an unheard-of
thing with a Japanese audience: to see a woman turn
so suddenly into a man was too much for their
equanimity.</p>

<p>Danjuro&rsquo;s finest and most artistic bit of acting is
in Japan&rsquo;s greatest tragedy, <i>The Chushingura</i>, in the
part of Goto, who, returning to his lord intoxicated,
falls asleep by the wayside. His master, finding him,
fires off a gun close to his ear. &ldquo;Most actors,&rdquo; said
Mr. Fukuchi, &ldquo;would fall asleep with their backs to
the audience, and when waking depend upon &lsquo;make-up&rsquo;
for an altered expression. Danjuro sleeps with his face
to the audience, and on the gun firing wakes up with
an entirely altered expression through the contraction
of the facial muscles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was curious to know from Fukuchi what were
the duties of the stage-manager in Japan. For some
time he looked thoughtful, as though unable to grasp
my meaning. &ldquo;We have no managers in Japan,&rdquo; he
said at length: &ldquo;the play has to do with the dramatic
author: it is for him to arrange everything. He must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
first think out every detail, and then consult with the
chief actor and proprietor. If these disagree, the play
is not produced.&rdquo; Mr. Fukuchi maintained that the
dramatic author must be absolute master of the situation,
interfered with by none. It would be impossible
for an actor or manager to have any conception of the
picture as a whole; therefore the dramatist must be
supreme. If an actor or an actress were permitted a
choice as to the colour or form of costumes, the work
would of necessity be ruined. There is no such thing
as the leading lady insisting upon wearing a puce dress,
as she does in England or anywhere on the Continent.
The manager does not know what &ldquo;puce&rdquo; means, nor,
probably, does the lady; but he sees no reason why she
should not wear puce if it pleases her. Accordingly
puce is worn, irrespective of scene harmony, and the
lady is content. In Japan such an occurrence would
be out of the question; but our Western stage is
already such a jumble that any little eccentricity on the
part of the leading lady in favour of puce or anything
else she fancies would be scarcely noticeable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:489px" src="images/img58.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A BLOND DAY</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; put in Mr. Fukuchi, &ldquo;that there
are dramatic authors in England who are not artists&mdash;that
they do not all understand colour harmonies and
line. Can this be true?&rdquo; I had to tell him that such
men were not uncommon with us. Fukuchi looked
serious, and was silent for a long while, meditating
as to how it would be possible for a dramatic author
to produce a play without a scientific knowledge of
art and drawing. &ldquo;I fail to understand this,&rdquo; he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
after some minutes&rsquo; thought; &ldquo;I cannot understand.
When I have finished writing my play, and when I have
talked with the chief actor, I make my drawings myself.
I must make the pictures, and I must give careful
directions to the costumiers and the carpenters. I
cannot understand how your dramatic author does this.&rdquo;
And the little man was genuinely perturbed.</p>

<p>The pictorial side of a Japanese dramatist&rsquo;s work
interested me keenly, and I begged Fukuchi to tell me
how he, as an author, prepared his drawings for the
costumier, stage-painter, and carpenter. &ldquo;Well, if you
like I will show you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am now writing a
historical play, the scenes of which will be like this,&rdquo;
and to my great amazement Fukuchi at once began
to draw in a rapid masterly manner the scene of a
gentleman&rsquo;s house and garden. No detail, however
trivial, was overlooked, and the infinite pains and care
with which he executed these delightful little drawings
both astonished and charmed me. I could see at once
the utter impossibility of any one attempting to interfere
with this man, who had a complete grasp of his subject
not only from the literary standpoint, but also from the
pictorial.</p>

<p>To give any idea of the exquisite delicacy and
precision with which these sketches of Fukuchi&rsquo;s were
carried out, I must describe one or two of the scenes.
First of all there was the garden; this was to have
on its right a bamboo fence, a pine-tree, and a grass
plot. On the left was placed a willow-tree, and
stepping-stones leading from the house to the gate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
Then the gentleman&rsquo;s house was to be considered. Mr.
Fukuchi decided that this was to be thatched and have
a projecting floor, while in front he placed a bamboo
fence, a well, and a cluster of chrysanthemums. &ldquo;Now
at the back of the house I must have a range of
mountains with autumnal tints,&rdquo; said Fukuchi; and no
sooner said than done&mdash;in a few minutes there stood
the range of mountains with their autumnal tints,
ranging from orange to brown, noted in the margin,
with directions as to the quality of cotton cloth to be
used for their construction. Every detail in this garden
scene was exact, and no one could have altered so much
as a leaf without ruining the picture. Next Fukuchi
proceeded to make for the costumier a drawing of a
girl. By the dressing of her hair the girl was shown
to be not over nineteen years of age, the ornaments
being one of red and the other silver. She was to hold
a fan, and Fukuchi even decided on the colour of the
fan and the way the girl should hold it. It was to
have a gold ground with a silvery moon, light and black
grass growing in white water. The lady&rsquo;s kimono was
of dark purple at the bottom and light purple at the
top; this was arranged purely for decorative reasons in
order to harmonise with the obi, which was black. As
a rule the colours in a dress graduate from the top
downwards; but the obi looked best against the light
purple, and custom was sacrificed to art. The figures
on the kimono were to be all white with silver strings,
and a delicate white wave pattern.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:491px; height:630px" src="images/img62.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A BLIND BEGGAR</p></div>

<p>Mr. Fukuchi next proceeded to consider the handling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
of historical colour. The scene was that of a
lord and his wife, the lord just setting out for the
wars and the wife seeking to detain him, holding on
to his armour. The armour is red and the clothes
are indigo. These colours being fixed historically, it
was for the artist to arrange backgrounds that should
harmonise with these. In the lady alone were his
artistic tastes allowed to expand. He would have
her dressed in white, with large chrysanthemums in
red, yellow, and purple tones.</p>

<p>These exquisitely clothed figures were to be placed
before a screen, having sea-rocks and an eagle painted
on it with black ink. Yet again another screen was
to be of light brown, with glittering birds delicately
traced upon it, in order that they should not interfere
with the breadth of the whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Fukuchi,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can quite see
that you are an artist, and that your handling of
a play from the decorative standpoint is quite
perfect. But now tell me something of your literary
methods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fukuchi began by telling me that in writing
a novel he wrote it as a poem, and when writing a
play he thought of it as a picture. But there are
periods in writing a novel when it in a way gets the
better of him, and develops unconsciously into a drama.
Then he told me of one or two stories he had recently
published, one of which began as a novel and ended
as a play. He said he could not understand the habits
of some authors of taking down scraps of conversation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
and using them for their finished works. He himself
spends his whole life listening to conversations and
studying the poses of people; but to take notes of
what they were saying would be hopeless; the notes
could never be used for fine artistic work. In planning
a play he sees it as a whole, as a series of pictures,
before beginning to pen a line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:490px; height:630px" src="images/img66.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE GIANT LANTERN</p></div>

<p>I was talking to Fukuchi about realism on the stage,
and he told me of the horror they have in Japan of
bringing live animals into a play; such a thing has
been attempted on one or two occasions, but always
with disastrous results. One enterprising actor, he told
me, spent much time in training a horse to take part
in a very fine production at one of the principal theatres.
The horse was trained to perfection, and on the first
night that it appeared, being a novelty, it was loudly
applauded; but the lights and the confusion so terrified
the poor animal that it sat down on the stage and
refused to move. Yet again another actor, determined
to outdo this former performance in originality, trained
a live monkey to take the place of the decorative pasteboard
monkey which had always been used on the
stage. This animal, unlike the horse, was trained to
know the stage as well as his master&rsquo;s room, and
grew quite accustomed to the lights and the people
surrounding him. So thoroughly at home was this
monkey that on its first appearance it swept the
stage of all the actors, caused confusion and distress
among the audience&mdash;in short, it behaved abominably,
and did everything but that which it had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
carefully trained to do. After this the pasteboard
monkey reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Mr. Fukuchi, although he is a brilliant English
scholar and has an intense admiration for Shakspeare&rsquo;s
works, thoroughly realises how impossible it would be
to attempt to put Hamlet on the Japanese stage: it
would suit neither the actors nor the public.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>THE LIVING ART</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">A Japanese</span> authority has boasted that the only living
art of to-day is the art of Japan; and the remark is not
so much exaggerated as it may appear at first sight to
the European. Art in Japan is living as art in Greece
was living. It forms part and parcel of the very life of
the people; every Jap is an artist at heart in the sense
that he loves and can understand the beautiful. If one
of us could be as fortunate as the man in the story,
who came in his voyages upon an island where an
Hellenic race preserved all the traditions and all the
genius of their Attic ancestors, he would understand
what living art really signifies. What would be true
of that imaginary Greek island is absolutely true
of Japan to-day. Art is in Europe cultivated in
the houses of the few, and those few scarcely know
either the beauties or the value of the plant they are
cultivating. That is the privilege of a class rather
than the rightful inheritance of the many. The world
is too much divided into the artist on the one hand
and the Philistine on the other. But it is not so in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
Japan, as it was not so in ancient Greece. In Japan
the feeling for art is an essential condition of life.
This is why I expect so much from the interest in
Japan which is now awakening in England.</p>

<p>The report of the Japanese Commission sent to Europe
to investigate the conditions of Western art, some years
ago, startled Western minds considerably. The Commissioners
gave it as their opinion that Japanese art
was the only real living art. This surprised, perplexed,
and irritated many people, as home truths generally do.
Without adopting in integrity every word of the Commission&rsquo;s
report, I must confess that I found in it a
great deal of truth.</p>

<p>The great characteristic of Japanese art is its intense
and extraordinary vitality, in the sense that it is no
mere exotic cultivation of the skilful, no mere graceful
luxury of the rich, but a part of the daily lives of the
people themselves. It is all very well to draw gloomy
deductions about the decay of Japanese art from the
manufacture and the importation of curios destined
for the European market. That there is such an
importation there can be no doubt, any more than
that this condition of things will continue while people
fancy that they are giving proof of their artistic
taste by sticking up all over their walls anything and
everything, good, bad, and indifferent, which professes
to come from Japan or to be made on Japanese models.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:494px" src="images/img74.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SUN AND LANTERNS</p></div>

<p>What an educated Jap would think of some of
our so-called &ldquo;Japanese rooms&rdquo; I shudder to imagine.
But let me ask&mdash;and this is much more to the purpose&mdash;what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
would an uneducated Jap think? And let
me give my own answer. He would be as much
surprised by any bad taste or bad art as his educated
superior would be. This is the burden of my argument&mdash;that
art in Japan is universal and instructive, and
therefore living; not an artificial production of a special
class, and therefore not living. Art was certainly a
living thing in the best days of Athens; art has been,
in some measure, a living thing elsewhere and in later
days. For we must remember that art does not merely
consist in the production of a certain number of works
of art, or even of masterpieces. A country may
produce a great many works of art, and yet as a
country be entirely lacking in living artistic feeling.
France is a land of works of art; but the works do
not appeal to the voyou&mdash;still less do they appeal to
the ouvrier, to the bourgeois, to the butcher, the baker,
the candlestick-maker. Now, what I claim for Japan
is that in its most real and most important sense it is
a living artistic country. The artistic sense is shared
by the peasant and the prince, as well as by the
carpenter, the fan-maker, the lacquer-worker, and the
stateliest daimio whose line dates back to the creation
of things.</p>

<p>But do not run away with my contention. I do
not mean to say that every Jap is a born artist. There
are Philistines in Japan, as elsewhere. What I do
maintain is that the artistic instinct is more widely
diffused, is more common to all classes of the community
in Japan, than in any of our European countries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
This is no small thing to say of a country. It is full
of deep significance to all students of art. Although
we are doing our best, with our love for gimcrackeries,
to cheapen and degrade the artistic capacity of Japan,
our evil influence has been but partially felt, and so
but partially successful. Having done all the harm
we can do unwittingly, let us pause, if possible, and
reflect before we wittingly do further mischief.</p>

<p>The problem to the lovers of art is simply this:
shall we learn all we can learn&mdash;and that is a great
deal&mdash;from the living art instincts of Japan, or shall
we continue to blunt and deaden the productive power
of Japan by encouraging the barbarous demand for
worthless baubles to make ludicrous the home of the
so-called aesthete? If those who are most proud of
the Japanese toys and trinkets they have amassed,
which, with semi-savage stupidity, they have nailed
upon their walls and stuck upon their shelves and
tables, could but see what an artistic house in Japan
is like, they would learn some startling truths as to
the real facts and principles of Japanese decoration and
the Japanese ideal of art. If they could only know
the contempt with which the truly artistic Jap looks
upon the demand for &ldquo;curios,&rdquo; and upon the kind of
&ldquo;curios&rdquo; which are turned out wholesale to meet that
demand, they would not feel so proud of themselves,
and of the rooms which they display to delighted
friends as &ldquo;quite Japanese, you know.&rdquo; The artistic
Jap shows nothing in a room&mdash;absolutely nothing,
except a lovely flower and a screen, and perhaps a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
beautiful verse or some clever sentence indited in freehand
writing, placed beautifully in the room in just
relation to its surroundings.</p>

<p>There is a curious fact to be noticed in connection
with such inscriptions. In conversation a friend might
happen to give forth some brilliant and very epigrammatic
utterance. The hearers are so delighted that
they get him to write down this <i>mot</i> in large
characters, and it is mounted and placed in the room.
Such a caligraphic maxim, written by the hand of
the speaker, they consider a fitting portion of the
permanent decoration of a room.</p>

<p>You would never know from the rooms of a Jap
that he was a great picture-collector. The wealthy
collector keeps all his treasures stowed away in what is
called a &ldquo;go-down&rdquo;&mdash;his storehouse&mdash;and his pictures
are brought up one at a time if any visitor is present or
expected. Generally a single picture will be brought
in and hung up. You enjoy that beautiful picture by
itself. It is very much like bringing a bottle of wine
from the cellar&mdash;no one would want the whole bin at a
time.</p>

<p>The Japs have an artistic temperament altogether
and the simplest craftsman is an artist in his own way.
I was especially struck with this once when I was in want
of some frames, and I employed a Jap to make them
for me. He could talk English perfectly well, and it
was remarkable to watch the development of the frames
and the enthusiastic temperament discovered by the
carpenter as he proceeded. I myself designed a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
frame, and I would by slight drawings encourage him
and his fellows to go on with the work. They all
took the greatest possible interest in the refinement
of the object&mdash;they would place it down and then go
off and look at it, and talk to those friends who were
looking on about the beauties they saw in it and in
its proportions; and the intelligence and pleasure they
showed were not only extraordinary but also delightful.
This frame-making was quite novel to them, as they
do not frame any of their objects; but they were
interested in the design of the frame and the placing
of the picture within it. Although the matter was not
in itself of any remarkable importance, I hold that it
fairly proves the artistic temperament of a chance
selection of people. Think of a common carpenter
making a simple thing and taking a just pride in
doing it! The result was that I got one of the most
beautiful frames you can conceive, and that I was
encouraged in my own work by the sympathy of these
workmen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:499px" src="images/img80.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SCARLET UMBRELLA</p></div>

<p>Of course, in Japan there are painters who paint
for the market&mdash;people who have been destroyed by
the British merchant and the American trader. They
spend their time in painting pictures of flowers and
birds in vivid colourings that appeal to our tastes, solely
for exportation to England and America. <i>Apropos</i> of
this I must mention a conversation I had with a painter
about screens, which struck me as being very curious.
I wanted to buy a gold screen, and he took me to a
shop where I saw a vast number of screens, nearly all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
with black grounds and golden birds and fish on them.
I told him I did not like them; and he answered,
&ldquo;Neither do we. Here in Japan we would not have
them in our houses; but they are what the English
and American markets demand. We ourselves never
buy them; we nearly always choose screens with light
grounds, beautifully painted&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, splendid pieces
of decoration. A screen painted by a first-class artist
is valued very highly, while the fact of one from the
hand of an old Japanese master being for disposal is
known all over the country at once, and everybody is
prepared to bid for it as one would bid for a Sir Joshua
here. A really good screen fetches an enormous price,
for it takes the place there of pictures and frescoes with
us, and every man of taste requires one or two fine
specimens in his house beautiful. One I saw at the
house of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was painted
with a blue wave&mdash;an arrangement, in fact, in blue and
gold. I never saw such a gorgeous screen, nor, I
verily believe, anything more beautiful as an arrangement
of colour&mdash;the huge wave, one sweep of blue,
and the piece of gold at the top. It was, I was told,
by an old master of Japan, and worth an enormous
sum. The Japanese perfectly appreciate the value of
things like that, and they very rarely let them leave
the country, so that it has become very difficult to
get hold of anything really fine.</p>

<p>An experience which gave me a close insight into
Japanese feeling was a meeting of some of the painters
of Japan. It was arranged by a Japanese gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
who, though not an artist himself, is deeply interested
in art, and keenly alive to everything touching it.
Knowing me personally, he was anxious that I should
come in contact with these men whose practice he so
much revered, and so he invited several of these
artists of different kinds&mdash;designers of metal work
and designers for manufactures&mdash;to his house to meet
me. I talked to them with his interpreting help, just
a little about art and its principles and so forth, in the
hope that the others would be brought to speak freely, and
I expressed my readiness to give them what information
I could of European art and its practice. They asked
me remarkable questions. Most of them, it appeared,
were discouraged because &ldquo;the European required such
ugly things.&rdquo; If they made what the Europeans really
enjoyed, their productions were looked upon as unsaleable.
It appeared to me that it must be extremely
difficult for the Japs to hold fast to their artistic instincts,
and in the end I expressed my conviction that it would
pay them better to adhere to their principles rather
than to pander to the foolish demands of the dull
American or British merchant who had neither idea
nor concern as to the beauty of the work he buys.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:490px" src="images/img84.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LEADING TO THE TEMPLE</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, to a great extent these traders are
lowering the standard of painting in Japan. Not a
few of these sixty men who came to meet me would do
work they did not care about, not being men of such
individuality and independence of character as Kiyosai.
With them, as with us, the prize of money-reward is a
bait too tempting to be resisted. Two days afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
some of these friends were good enough to write a
long discourse in one of the Japanese papers on my
address, saying how much pleased they were to find
an artist from England with my ideas of Japanese
art&mdash;one who condemned the notion so common
among them that it was necessary to pander to the
tastes of a foreign market. They were especially glad
that I had condemned that, and many of the painters,
more or less on the strength of my conversation,
decided to do thenceforth what they felt to be true
to their principles&mdash;to go to nature and themselves,
to choose their lovely harmony of colour, instead of
designing stereotyped screens with gold birds on black
backgrounds. Many were determined to give up that
kind of art altogether, and one in particular (whose
studio I called at the day after) pointed out that he
had already quite altered his style. He was an artist
by nature, and he told me he felt that having to do
this horrible work was going against him, and he had
made up his mind that in future he would insist upon
doing what he felt to be beautiful, and would be ruled
by the merchant no more. I visited the studios of a
great many of the artists to whom I had delivered my
lecture, and saw their sketch-books and their method
of work. In nearly every case their method coincided
with the principles laid down by Kiyosai&mdash;each having,
of course, his own method, but each working in the
same broad way of &ldquo;impression picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Japan might be said to be as artistic as England is
inartistic. In Japan art is not a cause, but a result&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
result of the naturalness of the people&mdash;and is
closely allied with all aspects of their daily life. In the
houses, the streets, the gardens, the places of public
resort&mdash;everywhere is to be found the all-pervading
element of art and beauty. A rainy day in Japan is
not, as it is in London, a day of gloom and horror,
but a day of absolute fascination. What a joy is the
spectacle of all those lovely yellow paper umbrellas
unfurling themselves beneath a shower like flowers
before the sun, so different from the dark shiny respectability
of our ghastly gamps at home! John Bunyan
has written and talked of the house beautiful; but the
Japanese have given to the nation not only the house
beautiful, but also (what is even more important to the
community at large) the street beautiful, and that is
where Japan differs so widely from Europe. As I
walk through the London streets at night, how prosaic
is the flicker of each gas-jet, within its sombre panes
of glass, in some &ldquo;long unlovely street,&rdquo; and how
different from the softened rays that shine from out
the dainty ricksha lanterns illuminating the streets in
Japan! There a poem meets your eye with each step
you take; and how pretty is every street corner, with
its little shop, its mellow light and dainty arrangements,
with the smiling face of some little child peeping out
from the dim shadow beyond! It is a terrible thing to
live in a country where art is the luxury of the few,
and where the people know as little of what constitutes
the beauty of life as a Hindoo knows of skating.
What would a Japanese gentleman say, I wonder, if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
passed into a room in the depths of winter and saw a
quantity of those pretty fans, which in his country help
to modify the heat of the golden summer days, viciously
nailed, without rhyme or reason, upon a bright red
wall, or those fairy-like umbrellas, upon which he has
seen the rain-drops glisten so brightly, stuck within the
gloomy recess of some lead-black hideous grate, or
(with still less sense of the fitness of things or regard
for the uses for which it was made) glued to a white-washed
ceiling?</p>

<p class="caption">BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN</p></div>

<p>We sometimes talk of the deteriorating influence
of European ideas upon Japanese art; but we have
failed to perceive the ghastly inappropriateness of
applying the Japs&rsquo; delicate flights of fancy to our
homes of discomfort. That usefulness is the basis of
all righteousness is the moral code by which a man&rsquo;s
position is gauged in Japan, and by which things are
made. It does not matter how beautiful an article may
be, or how trivial&mdash;whether it is a penholder, a snuff-box,
or a pipe&mdash;if it is not useful it is considered
inartistic, and will not be accepted by the Japanese
public. The form of a vase or a cup, or the shape
of a handle, must all be designed with a view to its
usefulness; and every little work of art that is made,
every cabinet and curio (apart from being decorative),
is designed to convey some maxim-like idea, a lesson
that will be useful and helpful in one way or another to
the beholder.</p>

<p>On entering a Japanese tea-house you will see a
kakemono hanging on the wall that strikes you at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
first glance as being a perfect picture, with the bold but
simple Chinese characters on the white silk and the tiny
slip of vermilion which is the signature of the artist.
It is placed well in the room, and is altogether a thing
of beauty; but when, on closer inspection, you read
the decorative letters, you will find that they give you
some dainty piece of advice to help you through the
day, or some pretty idea on which your eye and mind
can rest.</p>

<p>Then, again, the games that the children play in the
streets with sand or pebbles&mdash;they are teaching them
arithmetic, construction, patience, and innumerable
valuable lessons.</p>

<p>Usefulness is the basis of the ancient caste system
of Japan, which system exists at the present day, and
upon which the relative usefulness of a man depends.
Take the Samurai. They occupy the premier position
as Japanese aristocracy, because, although they wear
silk, they give up their lives for their country&mdash;and no
man can be more useful than that. The agriculturalist
ranks next in dignity; for none can do without food,
and therefore his usefulness is indisputable. Then
come the workmen, and last of all the merchants, who
are considered as &ldquo;no class&rdquo; in Japan and are greatly
looked down upon&mdash;producing nothing, they merely
turn over articles made by other hands for a profit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:494px; height:630px" src="images/img92.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;NEWS&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The most beautiful article we possess (one that
is entirely our own) is the hansom cab. It is perhaps
one of the greatest triumphs that the West has produced
in the shape of a conveyance, and simply because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
it has been designed with a view to its usefulness.
Would that we were always ruled by this splendid
quality! Unfortunately, we are not. We are ruled
by our own tastes, which, I feel bound to admit, are
not artistic. Think of the sombre, happy-go-lucky
arrangements of our London theatres. How is it
that in the best-managed of them an actress will so
far forget herself as to lie dying in the middle of a
snowy street in the dead of night, pale-faced and
wretched-looking, with ten thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of
jewellery on her fingers? Such a scene would drive
the artistic and consistent Japanese manager into the
nearest lunatic asylum. At the same time he would
be unutterably shocked at seeing a red moon (red, let
us trust, with the blush of shame at its creator&rsquo;s folly)
rising hurriedly behind some stage bank of roses,
swiftly and unnaturally hurrying across a purple sky,
and shamefacedly setting in the East, in the West, in
the North, in the South, within the brief hour of
an English stage, as if glad to escape the rapturous
applause of an inartistic public.</p>

<p>But perhaps nowhere is the difference between
European and Japanese art so sharply accentuated as
it is in the teaching of it in the great schools of the
West and of the East. Let us take the art schools
of Paris, which is considered by a vast portion of the
artistic world to be the very paradise of art. You
enter the crowded studio of some well-known master,
and you see before you a large white statue, the first and
predominant impression of which is its exceeding whiteness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
and to your mingled amusement and amazement
you discover that the unfortunate pupils are engaged
in a futile endeavour to render an impression of exceeding
whiteness by the aid of thick black chalk or charcoal.
As to how this is to be done with any degree
of verisimilitude you are no less at fault than they
are, poor dears, themselves; and therefore you will not
be surprised that, dazed and wearied as they must
be from the steady contemplation of this never-ending
pose, their work at the close of a day resembles the
figure from which they have been drawing as closely
as the work of Michael Angelo, or any of the great
Japanese masters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:489px; height:630px" src="images/img96.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A SUNNY TEMPLE</p></div>

<p>From the antique you pass to the life room. Here
another shock awaits you. In the middle of the room
stands a young girl, strapped up in the attitude of
Atalanta of classic fable running her immortal race.
These pupils are taught first of all to sketch the
figure in the pose of running as a skeleton. When
the hideous skeleton has been carefully and laboriously
committed to paper, it is with equal care imbued with
nerves and muscles and flesh. When all this is done,
a light Grecian drapery is flung on her, regardless of
the folds and movement that would eventually have
resulted from the fluttering of the breeze, and, mind
you, she is strapped up all the time. Then, when
all is completed, the poor dear lady is expected to
run her immortal race. Of course, by this time there
is no action in the figure at all. Atalanta appears
glued to the spot, and my only wonder is that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
does not indignantly chase her unfortunate creators
from the studio. On looking at these pictures the
spectator would say that he never saw anything so
absolutely unsuggestive of the breathless vigour and
energy of a healthy young girl engaged in a rapid
race as is indicated by the pitiful weariness of that
poor strapped-up creature in front of them. Would
it not be far better that these students should go
out into the street, after the method of the Japs,
and watch some girl as she runs and jumps in the
bright sunshine, with a soft wind blowing her hair
about her head and her gown about her limbs, and
then come back, and, with a memory of the beautiful
inspiriting scene still fresh in their minds, commit
their impressions &ldquo;hot and hot&rdquo; upon the canvas
before them?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:488px" src="images/img100.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ON THE GREAT CANAL, OSAKA</p></div>

<p>Still, England has not always been so hopelessly
inartistic. None would think of denying the perfect
taste of the architects who designed such buildings
as the Winchester and Durham Cathedrals, and Arundel
Castle; but those are buildings wrought in dead days
by men a long time dead, and England&rsquo;s days of
artistic appreciation are, I fear, as dead as they are.
Commerce and so-called civilisation have ruined us,
I fear, for ever. Japan is as artistic to-day as we
were five hundred years ago, and I rejoice to think
that at present there appears to be little fear of so
ghastly a fate as has overtaken us. As a nation the
Japanese remain faithful to art in all its details, and
as individuals they are still a nation of artists. Where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
else but in Japan would an aged gentleman dream
of rising ere the day has well begun, merely that he
might bring into harmony with all its surroundings,
and present in the best light possible, a little flower
placed in a pot&mdash;bending it this way and that way,
that its attitude might conform with the cabinet in
one corner of the room, or a screen in the other?
Who but a Japanese chamber-boy would be so impressed
with the artistic value of contrast merely
that he would feel constrained thereby to place the
can of hot water in a different attitude every time
he brought it into the room, and thoughtfully step
aside to regard its consonance with its immediate
surroundings? Art begins, as charity begins, at home;
and where the home of the individual is absolutely
artistic, it cannot fail that the whole nation should be
a nation of artists. I give way to none in my loyalty
to my country and my love for that country&mdash;I must
say that I do not think that there is a country better
in the whole world;&mdash;but perfection on this earth is
not only impossible, but to my idea also absolutely
undesirable&mdash;a perfect nation would be to the full as
dreadful as a perfect man. We are saved from perfection
by an almost entire lack of the artistic faculty,
and, however great we are in other respects, I am
sad to say we are thoroughly inartistic. To whom
but the Englishman would the golden dragons that
play so recklessly about on black screens with their
scarlet drooping tongues, that are sold in the Japanese
curio shops, possibly appeal? Who but English-speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
people would crave for those cherry-blossoms
embroidered on white silk grounds, which they so
gleefully carry away with them? Who but my inartistic
countrymen would insist on their cabinets being
smothered with endless and miscellaneous carvings?
The Japanese are too artistic to admit these things
into their own homes; but why are their dealers so
inartistic as (blinded by the desire of filthy pelf) to
put forth these embroideries for the English and
American market? Such things now and then make
me tremble for the future of art in Japan. It may
be (though I trust not) the thin end of the wedge;
it may be &ldquo;the little rift within the lute that by and
by will make the music mute, and, ever widening,
slowly silence all.&rdquo; What a tragedy it would be
that the music of this most perfect art should ever
be silenced in that lovely land, the resting-place and
home of the highest and only living art!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>PAINTERS AND THEIR METHODS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> methods of painters all over the world are very
much alike. In fact, the methods of great masters (no
matter of what nationality, and whether of this period
or of centuries past) are often precisely similar, while
there can be no doubt but that some of the finest masterpieces
ever painted very closely resemble one another.
I was once taken to see two photographs, one a portion
of a figure by Michael Angelo, and the other a portion
of a Japanese buddha by one of Japan&rsquo;s greatest masters;
and to my surprise I found that it was almost impossible
to detect which was which. This particular statue of
Michael Angelo&rsquo;s I had studied and knew well; yet
here was a portion of a Japanese god that looked exactly
the same&mdash;the same broad handling, the same everything.
In both there was the same curious exaggeration
of the bones and muscles, wrong from the anatomical
standpoint, yet conveying an impression of terrific
strength that is so typical of the work of Michael Angelo&mdash;indeed,
one masterly hand might have executed both
pictures. Yet the little Japanese artist, the creator of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
this Buddha, was but a modern, and in all probability
had never so much as seen Michael Angelo&rsquo;s pictures,
much less had he been in the slightest degree influenced
by him.</p>

<p>Japanese painters have a great admiration for
Michael Angelo&rsquo;s work, and for Italian painters in
general. If you were to show a Japanese artist, any
ordinary little minor artist, some photographs of masterpieces
by men such as Velasquez, Rembrandt, and
Botticelli, you would find that he would at once spring
on to the early Italian work, peer into it, hold it up,
devour it, muttering to himself the while&mdash;nothing could
tear him away. Rembrandt does not appeal to him
much; Velasquez not much; but Botticelli&mdash;yes. Still,
I have often thought that could Hokusai and Velasquez,
Kiosi and Whistler, have met and talked, they would
have had much in common with one another; for there
is in the works of each, although in many senses so
widely different, that simplicity, truthfulness, and restraint
which render them all so very much alike.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:493px" src="images/img108.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AFTER THE FESTIVAL</p></div>

<p>The broad principles of art are much the same all the
world over; but it is between the lesser artists of Japan
and the myriads of comparatively unknown artists of
Europe that there is so great a gulf fixed. Japanese
minor artists are artists indeed. Our minor artists are,
I fear, anything but artists. The veriest Japanese
craftsman is an artist first and a tradesman afterwards.
Ours is a tradesman first and last and altogether; and
even as a tradesman he is, I fear, a failure, for the
honest tradesman has at least something worth the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
selling, whilst our men&mdash;the jerry builder, the plumber,
the furniture maker, and the carpenter&mdash;give in return
for solid money an article which it would break the
heart of the merest artisan in Japan to put forward as
the work of his hands. But perhaps nowhere is the
difference between European and Japanese art so sharply
accentuated as it is in the teaching of it in the great
schools of the East and of the West. We Westerners
are taught to draw direct from the object or model
before us on the platform, whereas the Japanese are
taught to study every detail of their model, and to
store their brains with impressions of every curve and
line, afterwards to go away and draw that object
from memory. This is a splendid training for the
memory and the eye, as it teaches one both to see and
to remember&mdash;two great considerations in the art of
drawing. You will often see a little child sitting in a
garden in Japan gazing attentively for perhaps a whole
hour at a bowl of goldfish, watching the tiny bright
creatures as they circle round and round in the bowl.
Remarking on some particular pose, the child will retain
it in its busy brain, and, running away, will put down
this impression as nearly as it can remember. Perhaps
on this first occasion he is only able to put in a few
leading lines; very soon he is at a loss&mdash;he has forgotten
the curve of the tail or the placing of the eye.
He toddles back and studies the fish again and again,
until perhaps after one week&rsquo;s practice that child is able
to draw the fish in two or three different poses from
memory without the slightest hesitation or uncertainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
It is this certainty of touch and their power to
execute these bold, sweeping, decided lines that form
the chief attraction of Japanese works of art. Their
wrists are supple; the picture in their minds is sure;
they have learnt it line for line; it is merely the matter
of a few minutes for an artist to sketch in his picture.
There are no choppy hesitating lines such as one detects
in even the finest of our Western pictures, lines in which
you can plainly see how the artist has swerved first to
the right and then to the left, correcting and erasing,
uncertain in his touch. The lines will probably be
correct in the end; but when the picture is finished his
work has not that bright crisp look so characteristic of
the Japanese pictures. Then, again, when a Japanese
artist draws a bird, he begins with the point of interest&mdash;which,
let us say, is the eye. The brilliant black eye of
a crow fixed upon a piece of meat attracts his attention;
he remembers it, and the first few strokes that he
portrays upon his stretched silk is the eye of the bird.
The neck, the legs, the body&mdash;everything radiates and
springs from that bright eye just as it does in the animal
itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:495px" src="images/img112.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LEMON BRIDGE</p></div>

<p>Then, again, let us say a Japanese artist is painting
a typical Japanese river-scene, such a one as inspired
many of Mr. Whistler&rsquo;s graceful Thames etchings&mdash;a
quaintly formed bridge under whose dim archway a
glimpse of shipping and masses of detail can be seen in
the distance. To a Japanese artist the chief charm and
interest of such a scene would lie in that little view
beneath the bridge, and he would begin by drawing in,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
line for line, every little mast and funnel just as he sees
it, or rather as he remembers it. The picture slowly
expands as it reaches the margin, ending in the bridge,
which forms, as it were, a frame through which to view
the dainty richness of detail of the busy scene beyond.
If you were to arrest this picture at any moment during
its career you would find that it formed a perfect whole,
every line balancing the other; whereas, according to
our methods, if we were to draw the bridge first, timidly
suggesting the distance and leaving the detail and all
the fine lines to be put in afterwards, as so many artists
do, the picture until it was completed would appear
spotty and uneven. And even when finished there
would be no balance, for we neither understand nor
realise the importance of that quality without which
no work of art can be perfect.</p>

<p>The Japanese methods of drawing and painting are
entirely opposed to our Western methods, and in order
to give a slight insight into the works of the Japanese
painters I must describe these methods as minutely and
as clearly as is possible. To begin with, the size of an
ordinary picture is two feet by four and a half long,
and as a rule three times as much space is left at the
top as at the bottom of the picture. The brushes consist
of a series of round ones; they are flat-ended and vary
greatly in breadth, being named after the character of
work they are fitted for. Straw brushes are sometimes
used for coarse work. The silk that they paint upon
is prepared in the following manner. First the edges
of the wooden frame are pasted and the silk is rolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
loosely over, great care being taken to keep the grain
of the silk level. The surface of the silk is prepared
with alum and size, the proportion of which is about an
egg-spoonful of alum to a small tea-cupful of size. The
size is boiled and strained and diluted with water, and
the alum is added over the fire; it is again strained, and
is then ready for use. Finally, it is put on to the surface
while hot with a large brush. It is usual to put on two
coats, and a contrivance in the shape of a cross piece
of wood at the back of the frame is used for straining
the silk more tightly after the first coat of size. The
colours that the Japanese use are mixed and prepared
in the following manner. Whitening, which is the
basis of most colours, is pounded with a pestle and
mortar into a very fine powder; then a little size which
has been boiled and strained is poured in, and the whole
is beaten up and worked into a ball. This ball is
thrown over and over again into the mortar until it is well
beaten. A little water is poured over the lump, which
is then heated over a fire until it breaks and spreads.
In this state, after cooling a little, it is well worked
up, with perhaps the addition of water, until a white
pulpy putty is produced; the artist is very careful all
the time to avoid grit. Other colours are principally
prepared from powders, which are beaten up in little
porcelain cups with small pestles, and are mixed with a
little size and water into saucers, stirred all the while
with the finger and heated over the fire until dry, or
nearly so. When required for use they must be worked
up again with the finger and water, and it is a good plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
when first mixing the colours to paste paper over the
saucers, leaving a small hole for the insertion of the
brush. Gamboge and a vegetable red resembling
crimson lake are both used without size. The latter
is prepared from a woollen material which is torn up
into shreds and put into a saucer; then it is mixed with
boiling water and afterwards strained through paper.
It is drawn off in small quantities into several saucers
and carefully dried over the fire. There is a colour
which is much used called Taisha, which is like burnt
sienna; then there is Tan, a sort of orange, and Shi,
a vermilion red. The red is prepared in two different
ways, first by being mixed cold in a cup with a pestle,
a little size, and water. In this preparation the colour
separates into a deep red and orange, the latter floating
on the top. The orange is afterwards saved and used
instead of Tan&mdash;Tan, not being permanent, turns black
and disappears; it is used sometimes to shade ladies&rsquo;
faces, but fades very much. In using this preparation
of orange and red, the brush must be first dipped in
yellow and then the tip of it in the red, so as to take
up both portions of the mixture.</p>

<p>Another way of preparing Shi is to heat a saucer
until the finger can hardly bear the touch, and then
pour in some size and put the powdered pigment in it
while still on the fire. When it has dried it is taken off
and mixed with the finger very hot, a little water being
added gradually, until it is of a thickish consistency.
Shi thus mixed is of a deep red without any orange
precipitate, and is used for upper washes, for, having a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
great deal of orange in it, it would be too black if used
for undertones. In mixing indigo blue from a cake,
the saucer is put over the fire to dry, and a little size is
added. It is then rubbed with the finger, and water is
gradually added. Taisha, when in a cake, is also
prepared in this way. Taisha is used for the face
and hair. The hair is shaded off with Indian ink, and
the muscles of the face are washed in with Taisha
having no white but a little black mixed with it; the
feet and hands are handled in the same way. Then
the face is washed over again with the same colour,
only a little lighter. Broad masses of shading are
introduced, and the nose, mouth, and edge of the
cheek are generally left to be shaded in. It is considered
better to use a number of light tones than one
dark tone, and the washes on the face are repeated two
or three times. The hair also is washed over with a
large brush and rather dark ink; the eyebrows are put
in in a single wash; also the corners of the eyes and
mouth, which are flicked in and then washed off again.
The lips are put in with vermilion and shaded off with
another brush. A mixture of red, white, and Indian
ink forming a dull purple is used for the pupils of the
eyes, and the same mixture with a greater proportion of
red, and consequently a little lighter, is used for going
over the outline, and the ends of some of the lines are
washed off with another brush. The same purple colour,
but lighter still, is used as a backing to the outline in
order to soften the edges, and a few touches of purple
are painted in under the eyes and ears. The lips are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
touched with carmine, and the teeth and eyeballs with
a little white. The under-lip and corners of the eyes
are touched with lines or dots of light Indian ink, and
the top eyelids and tops of lower eyelids are outlined with
thin lines. The outline of the pupil is very fine; but
the dot of the eye is made very black; the nostrils are
painted in in light ink, shaded off afterwards and outlined
in black. The hair round the mouth is put in
in very light ink with a finely pointed brush.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:489px; height:630px" src="images/img118.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BEARING A BURDEN</p></div>

<p>There are many ways of painting the hair. Sometimes
a fine brush is used with single parallel lines, and
sometimes it is washed in with a broad brush with light
ink below and darker above. In old silk pictures great
depth used to be obtained by painting the hair on the
back of the silk as well as on the front. For painting
leaves a mixture of indigo and gamboge is generally
used with a full brush, the tip of the brush being dipped
in indigo. By this method, the dark colour on the tip
of the brush being after a time exhausted, the lighter
green appears, and thus a natural variety of gradation
is given to the colour of the leaves. Trees and rocks,
etc., are often scrubbed in with a rather dry brush
worked sideways and forming broken lines.</p>

<p>Another method of drawing a figure is to outline
in charcoal, after which the face with its markings is
outlined with a kind of Indian ink. Then with the
same Indian ink, but with broader lines and a large
brush, the drapery is boldly swept in with lines that
should break in parts and form a drag. This drag
must come naturally by pressing the brush firmly on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
the silk or paper; any attempt to force it would end in
failure. The hair should then be worked in with a large
spread brush, care being taken to give the hairs a radial
tendency and not let them cross confusedly. Sometimes
this hair is painted with a fine brush and with single
lines. For the background two large brushes are used,
one fitted with light ink and the other with plain water
to shade off the black. The face and the breast are
treated in the same way. The outlines of the drapery are
sometimes washed in with a lighter tone to project over
the edge and soften them. The face is washed with a
mixture of red and ink, leaving only the eyes. The
work is finished by using a small brush and very black
ink for the markings of the mouth, centre of the eyes,
under the eyelids, nostrils, and ear-rings.</p>

<p>Japanese artists study a great deal from life, and in
order to draw a figure full of spirit and action they will
often work in this way. Beginning with a very full
brush, they sketch in the general swing of the figure
with a few well-chosen broad black lines&mdash;as, for instance,
when drawing the legs of a horse or a lobster they will
put them in with one broad wash. Then they strain
thin Japanese paper over this spirited sketch, and begin
to elaborate on it with finer work, until in the end they
produce a picture that has high finish, but possessing
all the action and spirit of a first impression.</p>

<p class="caption">THE END OF THE DAY AND THE END OF THE FESTIVAL</p></div>

<p>The Japanese system of studying Nature in detail,
but not with a view to creating a picture, is perhaps
especially noticeable in their drawings of women. It
would be considered coarse and vulgar in the extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
to paint a woman in the glaring light of a studio,
copying every feature and wrinkle, line for line, as you
would copy a man. Kiyosai explains that it is impossible
to create a beautiful face by drawing direct
from life, especially in line. The only way in which
it can be achieved is by suggesting a natural beauty
on paper, and by imitating a conventional type away
from nature. The Japanese have a conventional type
of beauty just as we have, and just as the Greeks had
years ago&mdash;an ideal that has been evolved from the
aggregate of myriads of beautiful women,&mdash;and this
ideal of theirs must be a woman possessing small lips,
with eyelids scarcely showing, and eyebrows far above
the eyes. The forehead must be narrow at the top
and widening towards the base, looking altogether very
like a pyramid with its top cut off; the nose should
be aquiline, and the whole woman must appear to
be the personification of softness and delicacy. The
conventional type of a Japanese man has always the
legs and arms placed in impossible positions to denote
strength, and the muscles are greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p>In the old masters of Japan great importance is
attached to flesh markings, more especially in pictures
of men. In a sketch of a fat man trying to lift
a heavy weight, the action would be suggested in a
few swift lines with no shading, but just two small
horizontal lines at the back of the neck. Those two
little flesh markings portray the fat man to perfection,
admirably suggesting both the strain of the action and
the bulk of the man. But in talking of the art of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
Japan and the methods of the Japanese painter, I feel
that I cannot do better than describe a day that I
once spent with that greatest of all living artists,
Kiyosai, at the house of Captain Brinkley. This
gentleman invited Kiyosai to come to his house one
morning, and I was asked to watch and follow the
whole process of his work, and as far as possible to
learn from him his theories about painting. It was a
splendid chance for me as a painter, especially as Captain
Brinkley, who has resided in Japan for many years, and
is a Japanese scholar of high attainment, acted as
interpreter between Kiyosai and myself.</p>

<p>Kiyosai, I may say, is known all over Japan. From
the highest noble to the lowest ragged child in the
streets, all know the artist and love his work, for the
pictures of a popular painter get abroad in Japan much
as they get abroad here&mdash;Kiyosai&rsquo;s pictures and sketches
being reproduced and published in the Japanese papers
just as they would be published in Western magazines.
When any drawing by Kiyosai appears a rush is made
for the paper. These drawings of his are really superb
work, and I could not help feeling how great a privilege
it was to come into contact with such a man.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:501px" src="images/img126.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">IN FRONT OF THE STALL</p></div>

<p>I arrived at my host&rsquo;s quite early in the morning,
for I was to have a whole day with my Japanese fellow-worker.
I was introduced at once to an old man, grave
and very dignified in bearing, and I found it difficult
at first to realise that this was the painter of whom I
had heard so much. He was sitting on the floor
smoking, while his assistant was busy stretching silk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
and preparing colours. As a rule, to see a Japanese
smoke is to get at once a clue to the nature of the
people. But Kiyosai was peculiar even in this. He
was one of the few men who would take only one draw
from his pipe; in the most dignified manner possible
he would take that one whiff and then knock out the
contents of his pipe, repeating the process as long as he
continued to smoke. He had the most remarkable
hands, too, ever seen, with long and slim thumbs&mdash;more
sensitive, artistic, capable hands, from the
chiromancer&rsquo;s point of view, could hardly be. He
was enthusiastic, but prodigiously dignified, and used
his hands just a little, yet in the most impressive way.
He never rose from his sitting posture, and every time
I said anything that was at all complimentary he
received it with charming ceremony, by bowing to the
very ground.</p>

<p>No sooner was I introduced than his face seemed
to light up, his eyes became intensely brilliant, and his
conversation not less so. He was enthusiastic in his
desire to learn about English painters and English art
generally, and eager to tell me his own views of art,
and all he felt about it. To my pleased confusion, he
seemed to regard me with an interest equalling mine
for him. He put many questions about English art,
and told me much that was interesting about his own.
He spoke of the effect made on him by some English
pictures. &ldquo;I have seen a number of English and
European pictures,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but they all appear to
me very much alike. I hear that in England and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
over Europe they say the Japanese pictures look to
them all alike. Why is this?&rdquo; The explanation was
not immediately forthcoming, for at first sight it seemed
so extraordinary that to this man English pictures
looked all alike. But immediately the truth forced
itself upon me, as it will force itself upon the reader.
European pictures are all wonderfully alike. It struck
me that when, not long before, I was on a &ldquo;hanging
committee,&rdquo; and had passing before me several thousand
pictures, it was only here and there that my attention
was arrested by the individuality of some of the work.
For the most part they were the same pigments, the
same high lights, and the same deep shadows; and
mentally seeing this procession of pictures pass before
me, I could not avoid seeing how grievously alike
European pictures were. I had in some sort, indeed,
felt this before, and was delighted on having the impression
&ldquo;fixed,&rdquo; so to speak, by the Japanese master.</p>

<p>I saw a number of Japanese pictures, and I certainly
found them far more individual than our work is. We
say these Japanese works are insipid, out of perspective,
and all pretty much the same. Here is a painter of
Japan who brings a similar charge against our much
more complex pictures&mdash;this, surely, is a new and a
valuable lesson, full of suggestion for the thoughtful
painter!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:488px" src="images/img130.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE STALL BY THE BRIDGE</p></div>

<p>Kiyosai next began to discuss drawing, and, as he was
speaking to an Englishman, English drawing in particular.
&ldquo;I hear that when artists in England are painting,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;if they are painting a bird, they stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
that bird up in their back garden, or in their studio, and
begin to paint it at once, then and there, never quite
deciding what they are going to paint, never thinking
of the particular pose and action of the bird that is to
be represented on the canvas. Now, suppose that bird
suddenly moves one leg up&mdash;what does the English
artist do then?&rdquo; He could not understand how an
English painter could paint with the model before him.
I naturally told him that they copied what they saw;
that they got over the difficulty as best they could.
&ldquo;I do not quite understand that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my own
practice I look at the bird; I want to paint him as he
is. He has got a pose. Good! Then he suddenly
puts down his head, and there is another pose. The bare
fact of the bird being there in an altered pose would
compel me to alter my idea; and so on, until at last I
could paint nothing at all.&rdquo; I asked him what, then,
was his method. &ldquo;I watch my bird,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and
the particular pose I wish to copy before I attempt to
represent it. I observe that very closely until he moves
and the attitude is altered. Then I go away and record
as much of that particular pose as I can remember.
Perhaps I may be able to put down only three or four
lines; but directly I have lost the impression I stop.
Then I go back again and study that bird until it takes
the same position as before. And then I again try and
retain as much as I can of it. In this way I began
by spending a whole day in a garden watching a bird
and its particular attitude, and in the end I have remembered
the pose so well, by continually trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
represent it, that I am able to repeat it entirely from
my impression&mdash;but not from the bird. It is a hindrance
to have the model before me when I have a
mental note of the pose. What I do is a painting
from memory, and it is a true impression. I have
filled hundreds of sketch-books,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;of
different sorts of birds and fish and other things, and
have at last got a facility, and have trained my memory
to such an extent, that by observing the rapid action
of a bird I can nearly always retain and produce it.
By a lifelong training I have made my memory so
keen that I think I may say I can reproduce anything
I have once seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such, then, is Kiyosai&rsquo;s method of work. It is
purely natural, and one that has obtained for generations,
and that is the Japanese whole theory of art. Captain
Brinkley told me a story, the outcome of that conversation.
Kiyosai came one day to work at a screen which
Captain Brinkley was very anxious for him to complete;
but he could not finish it at the time, do what he
would. He said nothing; but it came out that he had
a fresh impression in his mind, and he could not go on
with the old impression until he had worked off the
new one&mdash;something he had seen on his way up to the
house.</p>

<p>The painters always live with fish, and birds, and
animals of different sorts. They have fish in bottles
and in ponds in their gardens. I went to many studios
in Japan, and I found each one with its ponds and fish
in the little garden surrounding the studio, and birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
as well. They always study nature, and I believe that
is the keynote of their art.</p>

<p>The technique of Kiyosai&rsquo;s work was most fascinating.
I had come away from England with all sorts of theories
concerning the technical part of an artist&rsquo;s work, and
when I got to Japan I found there was absolutely
nothing that was not known to this man. His method
of work, too, interested me exceedingly. To begin
with, the assistant brought his stretcher of silk&mdash;a
lovely piece of silk stretched across a wooden frame&mdash;and
placed it in front of him. Then, taking a long burnt
twig, he thought for a few minutes, looking all the while
at his silk&mdash;thought out his picture, indeed, before he put
a single touch on his canvas. How different is this from
the man who so often, with us, puts on a lot of hasty
touches in the hope that they will suggest the picture!
When this artist saw his picture complete in his mind,
he began with the little burnt twig to trace a few sure
lines. I never saw such facility in my life. A few
swift strokes indicated the outline on the silk of two
black crows; then he took up his brush and began at
once with the Indian ink, with full powerful colour;
and in about seven minutes he had completed a picture,
superbly drawn and full of character&mdash;a complete
impression of two black crows, very nearly life-size,
resting on the branch of a tree.</p>

<p>Kiyosai never amid any circumstances repeats himself:
every picture he paints is different, while for his work he
asks but a small price. After he had done his crows he
painted a coloured picture, beginning with Indian ink.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
First he tried all his colours, which were ready prepared
in different little blue pots and placed around him.
These little shallow pots or saucers had each its own
liquid, which the assistant had prepared to a certain
extent beforehand. They contained flesh tint, drapery
colour, tones for hair, gold ornaments, and so forth.
These colours had evidently been used before, as they
were in their saucers, merely requiring dilution before
immediate use. The saucers were arranged chiefly on
his right, with a great vessel of water, of which he used
a great deal. All his utensils were scrupulously clean.
When he began there was no fishing for tones as on
the average palette. No accident! All was sure&mdash;a
scientific certainty from beginning to the end. The
picture was the portrait of a woman. It displayed
enormous facility and great knowledge, and his treatment
of the drapery was remarkable; but altogether it pleased
me less. No attempt was there at what is called broken
colour. A black dress would be one beautiful tone of
black, and flesh one clean tone of flesh, shadows growing
out of the mass and forming a part of the whole. As
this work was a very simple impression, he finished the
coloured picture in a few minutes. But on the whole,
in one sense, it was less satisfactory. It appeared as if
he had studied his subject less, for it was a little conventional.
He was less happy in it; but, of course, he did
not admit this to himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:494px" src="images/img136.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ARCHERS</p></div>

<p>He did four pictures, and each of them took from
about seven to ten minutes, these constituting the finest
lesson in water-colour painting I ever received in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
life. Here is his idea of finish: once the impression
of the detail and the finish of the object is recorded
you can do nothing better; so far as the painter&rsquo;s
impression of finish goes, so far must the rendering go,
and no farther. Artistically he had become exhausted
by doing these four pictures&mdash;in invention, I mean.
You see, the man was heart and soul in the work. He
lives, poor fellow, on almost nothing. He is a very
independent man, refusing to work for money, and
declining to paint for the market.</p>

<p>Nearly every artist in Japan has his own favourite
stick of Indian ink, which he values as his very life. It
is essential that this ink should be of the very finest
quality, for they drink so much of it. In order to
execute those fine lines ending in a broad sweep that
is so characteristic of Japanese pictures, an artist must
first fill his brush with Indian ink and then apply it
to his lips until the tip becomes pointed. The ink is
of course swallowed; but if it is of a good quality, to
drink pints of it would not do a man the slightest harm.
A practical proof of this can be found in the fact that
Kiyosai, who is an old man, has been drinking Indian
ink steadily with every picture he has painted all through
his lifetime. He possesses a small piece of Indian ink
which is hundreds of years old, and which all the money
in the world could not buy. It is far too precious for
broad washes, and is only used here and there for bright
touches.</p>

<p>I noticed the tender way in which Kiyosai handled
this one precious piece of Indian ink, and that led to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
a very interesting conversation on blacks, after which
I realised that the variations and gradations to be procured
with black alone were enormous. Kiyosai told
me that when he was very young he was puzzled by
the exceedingly rich quality of black in one of his
master&rsquo;s pictures. It was a deep, velvety, luminous
black, and young Kiyosai struggled for weeks and weeks
to match it, but in vain. He came to the conclusion
that there must be some work going on at the back
of the picture, and at last one night he became so
desperate that, stealing into his master&rsquo;s room while he
lay asleep, he soaked off the picture which had been
pasted on to a board, and looked at the back of it.
One glance was enough, and little Kiyosai, with a
throb of pleasure, hastily pasted the picture together
again and stole away to experiment all that night on
silk and on paper, &ldquo;painting black both on the front
and on the back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I inquired of Kiyosai if he had ever painted in oils,
and he assured me that he had not; but a few days later
Captain Brinkley showed me a little picture painted in
lacquer by Kiyosai which, in my opinion, rivalled for
brilliancy any oil picture that has ever been painted, or
has still to be painted. The surface was as brilliant as
glass; yet the picture had a depth which no ordinary oil
pigment could hope to reach, while its deep luminous
shadows would put to shame the finest of Van Eyck&rsquo;s
pictures.</p>

<p>An English friend of mine resident in Japan once
told me a story of Kiyosai which struck me as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
being typical of that great master. A friend of his
had prepared four magnificent sliding panels covered
with the finest silk, and had given them to the painter
with the request that he would execute some of his
masterpieces on them for him. For eight or nine years
Kiyosai had kept those panels, and they still remained
bare; but great masters are always erratic, and the would-be
purchaser never gave up hope. One day, however,
he burst in upon my friend with the terrible intelligence
that Kiyosai was dead drunk and had ruined his panels.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s smashing away at them on the floor, and he is
simply crawling over them,&rdquo; he said in a towering rage.
My friend agreed to go round with him to Kiyosai&rsquo;s
house to try if possible to stop the outrage. When they
arrived they found the master in a high state of fever,
and looking more like a wild animal than a human
being, with his tusk-like teeth and his poor pitted face,
sweeping and hacking about all over the silken panels.
As they entered, Kiyosai left the room, leaving behind
him the panels scattered irregularly over the floor, but
each one smothered with work. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said my
friend very generously: &ldquo;it was I that introduced Kiyosai
to you, and it was I that suggested his painting these
doors; therefore it is only fair that I should relieve you
of them and find you a new set, which I will willingly do.&rdquo;
But the owner of the panels, shrewdly guessing that my
friend had not made this magnanimous offer without
some good reason, changed his mind and said that he
could on no account receive so costly a gift. He kept
them, and wisely too, for these four panels are now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
universally considered as some of Kiyosai&rsquo;s greatest
masterpieces.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:490px; height:630px" src="images/img142.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">REFLECTIONS</p></div>

<p>Strange to say, Kiyosai, when painting his finest work,
is nearly always drunk, and his weakness is often taken
a mean advantage of by the people around him. I
remember once attending a party given by a Legation
person who had invited a dozen or so of Japan&rsquo;s finest
artists&mdash;among them the great Kiyosai, the master&mdash;to
paint pictures on the floor for the edification of the
assembled guests&mdash;a rather vulgar proceeding. Kiyosai
resented this indignity with all the force of his passionate
nature, but out of kindness allowed himself to be
over-persuaded by his host. They made him drink and
keep on drinking to build up his enthusiasm; but,
boiling over with rage and indignation, he kept on
putting off his time until the whole twelve artists had
finished the sketches, although, fearing that the effect
of the drink would wear off, the guests begged him to
start at once. At last Kiyosai&rsquo;s time came. The silk lay
prepared on the floor, with the ink and brushes ready
for him to begin. Mad with rage and hating his
unsympathetic audience, Kiyosai stood, or rather knelt,
before his silk, fiercely grasping the brush, holding
it downwards with all his fingers round it and thumb
turned outwards. He looked like a god as he knelt
there, gripping his brush and staring at the silk&mdash;he was
seeing his picture. He executed a flight of crows, a
masterpiece&mdash;Kiyosai knew it was a masterpiece&mdash;and,
proudly drawing himself up to his full height, quivering
in every limb, he threw down his brush, skidded the silk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
along the floor towards the spectators, and, saying
&ldquo;That is Kiyosai,&rdquo; left the house in disgust. The
dignity of the little man cowed his spectators. Every
one unconsciously felt the magnetism of the man, and
realised that a master had been among them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>PLACING</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> Japan there is no such thing as accident. A scene
which in its beauty and perfect placing appears to
the visitor to be the result of Nature in an unusually
generous mood, has in reality been the object of infinite
care and thought and anxious deliberation to these little
Japanese artists, the landscape gardeners. That temple
which seems to place itself so remarkably well in relation
to the big lines of Nature, its background, has been
carefully built and thought out from that standpoint
alone. The great trees by the side of the temple, with
their graceful jutting boughs that form the principal
feature of the picture, have not grown like that, for
all their apparent naturalness; they have been nursed
and grafted and forced into shape with the utmost care
imaginable.</p>

<p>The sense of perfect placing, which is the sense of
balance, is the true secret of the Japanese art, by which
they attain perfection. All Orientals are more or
less possessed of this intuitive sense of balance, and
the Japanese carry it into the most minute details of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
daily life. If you enter a Japanese room you will
always find that the bough of blossom is placed in
relation to the kakemono and other furniture to form
a picture. And the special note of Japanese house
decoration is this bough of blossom, with which I was
immensely struck. Now, this is an altogether artistic
thing. At one party at which I was present I saw a piece
of blossom-bough put right out at a curious angle from
a beautiful blue jar. Turning to my neighbour, a young
Japanese friend who could talk English perfectly well,
I said, &ldquo;How beautiful that is!&mdash;although, of course,
its quaint curious form is merely accident.&rdquo; &ldquo;No&mdash;no
accident at all,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Do you know, it has been
a matter of great care, this placing of the plant in the
room in relation to other objects?&rdquo;&mdash;I was afterwards
informed that in many a household in Japan the children
are trained in the method of placing a branch or a
piece of blossom, and they have books with diagrams
illustrating the proper way of disposing flowers in
a pot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:491px" src="images/img150.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE RED CURTAIN</p></div>

<p>The outsides as well as the insides of their houses are
decorated in the harmonious principle, even to the painting
of signs in the street. They are most particular
about placing their richly coloured sign duly in relation
to its surroundings. In the same way&mdash;whether the
subject may be done in a string of lanterns or what not&mdash;whatever
is done is done harmoniously, and in no
case is decoration the result of accident. The sum of
it all is that every shop in an ordinary street is a perfect
picture. At first you are amazed at the beauty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
everything. &ldquo;How in the world is it,&rdquo; you ask yourself,
&ldquo;that by a series of apparent accidents everything
appears beautiful?&rdquo; You cannot imagine until you
know that even the &ldquo;common man&rdquo; has acquired the
scientific placing of his things, and that the feeling
permeates all classes. Perhaps, however, one of the
most curious experiences I had of the native artistic
instinct of Japan occurred in this way I had got a
number of fanholders and was busying myself one afternoon
in arranging them upon the walls. My little
Japanese servant boy was in the room, and as I went
on with my work I caught an expression on his face
from time to time which showed that he was not over-pleased
with my performance. After a while, as this
dissatisfied expression seemed to deepen, I asked him
what the matter was. Then he frankly confessed that
he did not like the way in which I was arranging my
fanholders. &ldquo;Why did you not tell me so at once?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;You are an artist from England,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;and it was not for me to speak.&rdquo; However, I
persuaded him to arrange the fanholders himself after
his own taste, and I must say that I received a remarkable
lesson. The task took him about two hours, placing,
arranging, adjusting; and when he had finished the
result was simply beautiful. That wall was a perfect
picture; every fanholder seemed to be exactly in its
right place, and it looked as if the alteration of a single
one would affect and disintegrate the whole scheme.
I accepted the lesson with due humility, and remained
more than ever convinced that the Japanese are what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
they have justly claimed to be, an essentially artistic
people instinct with living art.</p>

<p>It is, in point of fact, almost impossible to exaggerate
the importance attached to the placing of an object by
every Japanese, and it would be no exaggeration to say
that if a common coolie were given an addressed envelope
to stamp he would take great pains to place that little
coloured patch in relation to the name and address in
order to form a decorative pattern. Can you imagine
a tradesman and his family, wife and children, running
across the Strand to watch the placing of a saucepan in
their window? Yet this is no unusual occurrence in
Japan. You will often see a family collected on the
opposite side of the road watching their father place a
signboard in front of his shop. It might be a grocer&rsquo;s
shop, and all&mdash;even to the mite strapped to the back of
its sister&mdash;are eagerly watching the moving about of
this board, and are interested to see that it should place
itself well in relation to the broad masses around, such
as the tea-box, etc.</p>

<p class="caption">FLOWER OF THE TEA</p></div>

<p>Now, people who think so much of the details of
balance must necessarily approach art in a very different
manner from that in which we approach it. Would a
tradesman in England hesitate before placing his stamps
on a bill? The tradesman in Japan does. Imagine
an artist spending three days in anxious thought as to
where he should place his signature on his picture!
And yet this is what Kiyosai, the greatest of modern
painters, actually did before he affixed his red stamp
to the hasty sketch of a crow. I have known little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
Japanese painters to ponder for hours, and sometimes
weeks, over the placing of this little vermilion stamp so
that it shall form perfect balance, and in all probability
the picture itself has only taken a few minutes. Suppose,
for instance, a painter has contrived to produce a rapid
sketch of a flying crow, or perhaps a fish. That fleeting
impression was so strong that he was able to produce
it at once without any hesitation; but however vivid
and lifelike the picture might be, if the balance were
destroyed by the ugly placing of this one little spot
of vermilion, from the Japanese standpoint the picture
would be utterly worthless. And the proper placing of a
thing is really most important. Even the most ignorant
and uneducated in matters of art are influenced on seeing
a perfect bit of placing. To live with some beautiful
thing, a flower or a bough well placed, to watch its
delicious curves or the tender buds of a purple iris just
bursting, must give joy, and it does, although one may
be quite unconscious of its gentle power.</p>

<p>The Japanese understand these subtleties as do no
other nation. If they are entertaining a guest, their
one aim and object is to make him perfectly and
deliriously happy; they strive to divine his inmost
thoughts and desires; it is their ambition to satisfy
them to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, an American, once gave me a
description of a week he had spent with a very ancient
Japanese gentleman in a little country village; it was
a week of intense interest and happiness to him, one
which, when he grows to be as old as his host was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
then, will still remain in his memory with a lingering
sweetness as something good to be remembered, something
purer and quite apart from the regular routine
of his past life. He was a student, a naturalist; and
the purity of this Japanese household, the seclusion and
dainty decoration of his study, the freedom of it all,
and the kindly attention and sympathy that was proffered
to him by every member of the family combined
to make the quiet recluse feel, for once in his life,
almost boisterously happy. Towards the end of his visit
he tried to look back and discover what it was that
had brought about this unwonted feeling of joy in him,
little realising that all this time these dear people had
been scheming and planning for no other object than
to give him pleasure. It was not until the last day
of his stay, however, that it all unfolded itself clearly
before his eyes, and that he learnt the reason why he
had been so happy. On this last morning he had
chanced to rise early&mdash;at daybreak, in fact&mdash;and as he
passed the room that he had been using as a general
sitting-room, he saw through the partially-opened sliding
doors a sight which caught his breath with amazement,
and made tears spring to his eyes. There was his host,
the dear ancient Japanese gentleman, kneeling before a
bough of pink blossom, which he was struggling to
arrange in a fine blue china pot. The naturalist stood
and watched him for nearly an hour, as he clipped a
bough here, and bent a twig there, leaning back on his
heels now and then to view his handiwork through
half-closed eyes. He must see that the blossom placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
itself well from the decorative standpoint in relation
to the kakemono that hung close by; he must also see
that the curves of the bough were correct; and the
care taken by this old gentleman in the bending of the
bough was a lesson to my friend. It became clear to
him that every morning his aged host must have risen
at daybreak to perform this little act of kindness.
Like a flash he remembered that each day there had
been some dainty new arrangement of flowers placed
in his room for him to enjoy. He had not given it
much thought, for it looked more or less like an
accident, flowers that had formed themselves naturally
into that shape; yet, all unconsciously, this little bit of
perfect placing had influenced his work and had gone
far towards making the visit so joyous to him. He did
not understand placing; but it interested him and gave
him an intense amount of pleasure, in the same way
that superbly fine work always does even to the most
uneducated.</p>

<p>The proper placing of objects is not only an exact
science, but also it forms almost a religion with the
Japanese. When you just arrive in Japan you are at
once impressed with the perfect placing of everything
about you. You find yourself surrounded by a series
of beautiful pictures; every street that you see on your
journey from the station to the hotel is a picture; every
shop front, the combination of the many streets, the
town in relation to the mountains round about it&mdash;everything
you chance to look at forms a picture. In
fact, the whole of Japan is one perfect bit of placing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">HEAVY-LADEN</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Nature has favoured this place,&rdquo; says the globe-trotter.
&ldquo;I never found when I lived in Surrey that
great trees placed themselves against hill-sides so as to
form perfect pictures. I never saw the lines of a
bush pick up those of a fence with one broad sweep.
Nature never behaved like that in Dorking.&rdquo; Of
course Nature didn&rsquo;t; nor does she in Japan. There
the whole country, every square inch of it, is thought
out and handled by great artists. There is no accident
in the beautiful curves of the trees that the globe-trotter
so justly admires: these trees have been trained
and shaped and forced to form a certain decorative
pattern, and the result is&mdash;perfection. We in the
West labour under the delusion that if Nature were
to be allowed to have her own sweet way, she would
always be beautiful. But the Japanese have gone
much further than this: they realise that Nature does
not always do the right thing; they know that occasionally
trees will grow up to form ugly lines; and they
know exactly how to adapt and help her. She is
to them like some beautiful musical instrument, finer
than any ever made by human hands, but still an
instrument, with harmonies to be coaxed out. And
the Japanese play on Nature, not only in a concentrated
way as with a kakemono or a flower in a room, but
also in the biggest possible form, on landscapes;
dragging in mountains, colossal trees, rushing cataracts&mdash;nothing
is too much or too great an undertaking
for these masters of decoration. Any ordinary little
baby boy that is born in Japan has almost a greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
decorative sense than the finest painter here in the
West.</p>

<p>All this beauty and perfection that meets one on every
side is the result of centuries and centuries of habit, until
it has become intuitive to the people. I can safely say
there is no point in Japan where an artist cannot stand
still and frame between his hands a picture that will be
perfect in placing and design. In a Japanese garden,
every stepping-stone, every tree, every little miniature
out-house, is thought out as a bit of placing to form
perfect balance. And it is thought out not as an
isolated bit of Nature, but in relation to everything
around that you can see, whether it is a temple, a large
tree, or the side of a hill; and whatever position you
happen to be in, in that garden you will always see
a perfectly balanced picture. When you have been
pottering about in the towns for some weeks, you
eventually become accustomed to the idea that everything
is thought out by these brilliant students in order
to form a picture, and you begin to feel proud of the
knowledge you have gleaned and to make practical use
of it. You escort your friends, who are a trifle fresher
than yourself, about the towns, pointing out to them
that there is no accident in all the beauties that they so
much admire&mdash;the shops, the signboards, the placing
of the flower by the side of the workman&mdash;all this has
been carefully thought out from the decorative standpoint,
to be beautiful. But then, when one travels from
the beaten track, away out in the country, even the
resident who is by way of being artistic, and has had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
the fact that the Japanese are an artistic people driven
into his stupid head by sheer force, even this poor dear
is swept off his feet when he finds that Nature is still
going on doing the same thing all these miles away
from the town. He has probably come to view the
cherry-blossom, and he discovers to his amazement
that these huge hill-sides of blossom place themselves
perfectly one against the other&mdash;colossal trees with
jutty boughs frame themselves against the sides of
the mountains to form a picture. One huge sweep
of blossom is thought out in relation to another
sweep that is deeper in tone; near by is a curiously-shaped
bare patch of earth which is designed to give
value to the brighter colour; and so it continues
indefinitely.</p>

<p>The whole country is thought out in huge blotches
to form a picture perfect in harmony and in design. I
once had a very interesting experience of the felling of
a tree in Japan, and here again placing formed a very
prominent part of the proceedings. Of course this
was placing of a nature very different from the artistic
placing that I have just described; but as a scientific bit
of work it was simply wonderful! It was an enormous
tree by the side of a temple; there were two little
men sawing away at its base, little mites of men, half
hidden by the huge gaping crowd, chiefly composed
of children, that stood watching the performance,
waiting for the tree to fall. A wall stood close by
with an opening cut in it, just large enough to allow
the trunk to place itself; and away in the distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
strewn about at different angles were a series of huge
stone boulders, and these, I soon found out, were to
split up the boughs for firewood when the tree fell,
thus saving labour. Imagine the science of it&mdash;the
calculation and the accuracy of their judgment! The
men went on sawing, every now and then pausing
in their work to look up at the sky with their
backs against the wall. At last there came a moment
when the excitement was terrific: the trunk was nearly
sawed through, and the tree seemed prepared to fall
anywhere and everywhere, more particularly in my
direction. Presently it began to give slightly, and it
was one of the prettiest and most wonderful things I
have ever seen in my life, the way that tree began to
bend&mdash;gently, gracefully, ever so gently, the trunk
fitting itself into the wall, and the branches dashing on
to those great boulders that were waiting for them,
splitting them up into fragments. Those little mites of
Japanese handling that giant of a tree was a sight that I
shall never forget. Where we would have had twenty
men with ropes and paraphernalia, they had nothing
but their big heads and their power to place a thing
mathematically in the right position to help them. And
it all looked so graceful and so easy that it would not
have surprised me in the least to have seen one of those
little men come sailing down on the branches. But
what struck me the most forcibly was the great
confidence of the people. They all stood round,
almost touching the tree, but quite sure of the success
of this venture; the fact that it was possible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
wood-cutter to fail never occurring to them for an
instant.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:489px; height:630px" src="images/img168.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PEACH-BLOSSOM</p></div>

<p>Placing takes a prominent part in everything that
the Japanese undertake; it shows itself not only in
the arrangement of the landscape and in artistic matters
where there is scope for their decorative powers, but
also in small, out-of-the-way, inartistic things, as, for
instance, photography. I have seen in the Tokio
shop-windows photographs taken by native correspondents
during the Chinese war, and it was quite
extraordinary how their sense of placing showed itself
even in this. You never by any chance see a photograph
by a Japanese looking in the least like a European. If
they photograph a group of men they will be sure to
place that group near a great bough that juts across the
picture; they cannot help it&mdash;it seems to be in the
blood of a Japanese to be decorative. Their taste with
regard to enjoyment is widely different from ours: a
little bit of Nature which would give them intense
pleasure would probably be ignored by us altogether.
We want parks and stags and moorlands, broad expanses
of country and huge avenues, while the Japanese
will be content with one exquisite little harmony. They
will gaze for whole hours in rapture at a little branch
of peach-blossom, only a cluster, just a few inches of
rose-red peach-blossom, with a slim grey twig, placing
itself against a background of hills that stretch away in
the distance indefinitely.</p>

<p>At the same time they love expanse of view as well.
It is one of their greatest joys to look from the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
a mountain downwards, but only at certain times of the
day. A Japanese, holiday-making, will sometimes spend
one whole day waiting for an effect that will perhaps
last only a few moments, or he will toil for hours up
a mountain-side to enjoy the exquisite pleasure of a
fleeting colour harmony.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>ART IN PRACTICAL LIFE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Throughout</span> this book I have talked of Japan purely
from the artistic standpoint. I have talked principally
of the living art of the country and of its exquisite
productions, and I firmly believe that it is because
the Japs are a people of imagination that they will
at no distant date forge ahead of other nations (who
are depending solely upon their muscle) and become a
dominating power.</p>

<p>At the same time, it must be clearly understood
that the artistic is not the only quality in which the
Japs excel. Take them from any side, and it will
be found that they have achieved remarkable success.
Yet the average Westerner, on returning from a visit
to Japan, has always the same superficial observation
to make on the Japanese people. He has spent a
few weeks in the Land of the Rising Sun; he has
seen the dainty tea-houses, the miniature bridges, the
paper walls and umbrellas, their works of art modelled
in lead&mdash;everything suggesting the dainty and the
exquisite (and therefore, in his opinion, the flimsy);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
and he tells you that the people over there are all
dear little Noah&rsquo;s Ark folk living in tissue-paper
houses, very charming as dolls, but useless as men.
&ldquo;These people,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;have no physique; they
would be incapable of building battleships, for example.&rdquo;
For this critic one can entertain only the faintest
possible feeling of tender pity. Is he not aware that
these Noah&rsquo;s Ark folk are actually building battleships,
that they have already a fine army superbly equipped
with the finest of swords and guns, and that they
have the power to handle these weapons far better
than we can handle ours? Every soldier in the
Japanese army understands the mechanism of his rifle,
and can at any moment pull it to pieces and put it
together again, even substituting a missing portion
if necessary. Could the same be said of our beloved
Tommy? The Japanese officers are no less capable
than the privates, and I would guarantee that if by
some mischance the sword of a Japanese officer, being
badly tempered, should become bent, that officer would
be capable of retempering his blade&mdash;one of the most
difficult and delicate tasks imaginable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:493px" src="images/img176.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE TEA-HOUSE OF THE SLENDER TREE</p></div>

<p>But how a certain class of equally ignorant and
inconsistent Westerners cried out when it was known
to the world that Japan had actually begun to use
our rifles and to build battleships! They will lose
individuality and degenerate, they are adopting Western
methods, and it will kill their art, they complained.
How foolish this is! The Japanese have merely
changed their tools&mdash;exchanged the bow and arrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
for the sword; they are just as artistic and just
as intelligent as in the bow-and-arrow days; and
they have proved themselves to be equal to, if not
better than, any other soldiers in the world.</p>

<p>Japan is not being Westernised in the smallest
degree: she is merely picking our brains. And how
quickly the Japs will adopt a Western idea, and
improve upon it! The making of matches, and the
underselling us in all our common printed cotton and
woollen Manchester goods, have not spoilt their faculty
for executing that exquisite Eugene dyeing for which
the Japanese are famous all the world over; the
making of bolts and bars and battleships has not
prevented the metal-workers from producing exquisite
work in bronze, so delicate as to resemble the finest
lace. The manufacture of our vulgar modern monstrosities
has been taken up by these people, and they
can offer them to us at a cheaper rate and of a
better quality than we can produce ourselves, freight
included. Japan can produce European work better
than the Europeans themselves; but that work has not
influenced their art one whit&mdash;they hate it; whereas
Japanese art has permeated and influenced the whole
of the West.</p>

<p>All these qualities seem to point one way&mdash;Japan
must eventually become a ruling power. For one
thing, the struggle for life does not exist there as in
other countries. The food is simple, and men live
easily. Then, again, the Japanese are not over-anxious.
They do not waste their energies. Women do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
fret because they are looking old; on the contrary,
it is their ambition to become old, for then they are
more respected.</p>

<img style="border:0; width:488px; height:630px" src="images/img180.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BLOSSOM OF THE GLEN</p></div>

<p>My first experience in Japan, I being a practical
person and of a practical turn of mind, was rather
a surprise. I had just arrived at the hotel in Tokio,
and, observing from my window that there was a
promise of a sunset, I caught up my paint-box, anxious
to secure the fleeting effect, and rushed downstairs
full-tilt, in my haste almost capsizing an old lady
with a monkey on her shoulder standing at the foot
of the stairs. Not moving from her position, she
said, &ldquo;Young man, I should like to talk to you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Delighted, I am sure,&rdquo; I answered hurriedly: my
haste to be off, I am afraid, was too apparent just
then. Not at all daunted, the lady called after me
some directions for finding her in her room that
night after dinner, where she would tell me some
things that would interest me, and walked slowly
up the stairs without once looking round, her monkey
on her shoulder. Curiously interested, despite myself,
in this strange old lady and her monkey, I did visit
her that evening, and was somewhat startled by her
greeting of me. &ldquo;I knew I was going to meet you
in Japan to-night. I know all about you. You are
going to paint a series of pictures. You are going
to exhibit them, and you will make a great success.
Some day you will paint children&mdash;you are fond of
children. All this I knew in America before ever
I came here. I saw it all as in a dream.&rdquo; Paralysed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
I could only utter the formal words, &ldquo;Oh, really!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re sceptical! But you are sympathetic too,
and after I have talked to you for two or three hours
you will see that I am right,&rdquo; quoth my strange new
friend, while at the prospect of two or three hours&rsquo;
conversation I experienced a distinctly sinking feeling.
But with the next few words she uttered, the sinking
feeling vanished, to be superseded by one of deep
interest. For some years, she told me, she had been
constantly communing in the spirit with her husband
and Lord Byron&mdash;rival spirits. Her husband was
jealous of the poet and of her correspondence with
him, and she showed me a series of letters dictated
by that great man in the dark&mdash;all sorts of beautiful
letters on all subjects, ranging from tennis to theology.
I sat there I know not how long listening to this
wonderful woman; and also&mdash;it may seem foolish&mdash;I
felt strangely comforted and encouraged to hear her
say so convincingly that I was to make a success, for
at that period I had never painted a picture, and the
whole thing was, as it were, an experiment. It was
many weeks before I could forget that old lady and
her monkey. All through my travels the memory of
that monkey&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;beady, blinking, never changing&mdash;followed
me, and stimulated me.</p>

<p>With Tokio and Yokohama I was disappointed.
I had the privilege of attending the Mikado&rsquo;s garden
party; but the pleasure of the really beautiful grounds
and the cherry-blossom was spoilt by the Western dress
of the guests and of high personages&mdash;a hideous substitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
for the Japs&rsquo; own graceful garments. Yokohama
I found especially unsympathetic. The bulk of the
Europeans I met there seemed to be spending half
their time in abusing Japan and everything Japanese.
Strange that a colony of such unrefined, uneducated
people should presume to criticise these artists! Tokio,
with its formal dinners and conventionalities, was much
the same; and with epithets such as &ldquo;Crank&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Madman&rdquo; hurled after me, I fled to Kioto, there to
lose myself in endless and undreamt-of joys.</p>

<p>In Japan there are flowers blooming all the year
round: the country is a veritable paradise of flowers.
When a certain flower is at its height, whether it be
the wistaria, the chrysanthemum, or the azalea, that is
a signal for a national holiday, and, dropping business
and all such minor considerations, the whole of Japan
turns out and streams through the parks and through
the country to picnic in the sunshine, under the flowers.
I arrived in Japan in the spring, and the country was
pink with blossom. Infected with the delightful fever
for blossom-dreaming, I drifted aimlessly along with
the crowds, drifting only too rapidly into their own
restful atmosphere, and accustoming myself to the
delicious theory that life is long with plenty of time for
everything. And as I sat in the sun among these light-hearted
people, watching mountains of pink blossom
under a clear blue sky, it did seem ridiculous to think
of work and worry.</p>

<p>Those first few weeks in Japan come back to me as
something to be remembered. To my untravelled mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
everything seemed so novel, so quaint, so unexpected.
Things were large when I expected them to be small,
and <i>vice versâ</i>; the houses were made of paper; the
women were anxious to make themselves look old. I
was fascinated by the pyramids of children gazing in at
sweet-stuff shops with their brown, golden, serious faces
contrasting so oddly with their gaily-coloured dresses
painted to look like butterflies. Every child I saw I
felt that I must either pat or give it something. I was
surprised to see fowls with tails so long that they had
to be wound up into brown-paper parcels; the dogs
that mewed like cats; miniature trees hundreds of years
old. I was surprised when I dined out to find the room
decorated with beautiful ladies in lieu of flowers, a
delightful substitute. To be taken to the basement
and handed a net with which I was to catch my own
carp was also rather a surprise; but when I was expected
to eat it as it lay quivering on my plate, I was more
than surprised&mdash;I was roused. Material for pictures
surrounded me at every step. I wanted to make pictures
of every pole and signboard that I came across; and
the result of this glut of subjects was that I never
painted a stroke. Night in Japan fascinated me almost
more than anything&mdash;the festoons of lanterns crossing
from one street to another, yellow-toned with black and
vermilion lettering; the gaily-dressed little people
passing by on their wooden clogs or in rickshas with
swinging paper lanterns drawn by bronze-faced coolies.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first rainy day in Japan. I
went out in the wet and stood there, hatless but perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
happy, watching the innocent shops light up one by
one, and the forest of yellow oil-paper umbrellas with
the light shining through looking like circles of gold,
ever moving and changing in the purple tones of the
street.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did on arriving in Japan
was to hire a servant, and this little man soon became
my adviser in artistic as well as in mundane matters.
He took a keen interest in my work, and spent the
greater part of his spare time in hunting up subjects for
me&mdash;monograms, suggestions for picture-frames, and
what not&mdash;he, like every Jap, was an artist. He never
said that he liked anything that I ever painted (he was
far too truthful for that); but it was quite obvious that
he did not, for he could draw infinitely better himself.
But he helped me a great deal.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:484px" src="images/img186.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A FAMILY GROUP</p></div>

<p>So did the policemen&mdash;and the policeman in Japan is
a perfect treasure. They are all gentlemen of family and
are very small men, much below the average in height;
but they have nearly all learned the art of scientific
wrestling, and exercise an absolute and tyrannical power
over the people. Luckily for me, I never made the
hopeless blunder of attempting to tip them. Altogether
I found the policeman the most delightful person in the
world. When I was painting a shop, if a passer-by
chanced to look in at a window, he would see at a
glance exactly what I wanted; and I would find that
that figure would remain there, looking in at the shop,
as still as a statue, until I had finished my painting;
the policeman meanwhile strutting up and down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
street, delighted to be of help to an artist, looking
everywhere but at my work, and directing the entire
traffic down another street.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a fire&mdash;there is invariably a
fire when one arrives in a foreign country, I notice.
Immediately the policemen begin to plant little bamboo
sticks round the burning building with twine fixed from
one stick to another. This is to act as a barrier to keep
the people off. After a time a crowd gathers, and in
the swaying of the people their chests sometimes touch
the string and bow it; but the thought of breaking
through that twine never occurs to them. The bold
little firemen inside the enclosure trying to scare away
the god of fire by bright clothing, and literally sitting
on the flames in their light-coloured coats, form a scene
never to be forgotten. They seem to bear charmed
lives as they dash among the flames, putting the fire
out with their hands, and in a very short time too. It
reminds one of the performance of the fire-eating
gentlemen at the Aquarium.</p>

<p>The power of the policemen over the people in
Japan is extraordinary. Even the Westerners obey
them. At the treaty ports they often have to deal with
English sailors, and, although they try their utmost to
smooth things over, they often have to run men in.
It is entertaining to see a great blundering sailor, just
like a bull, plunging to right and left, while the little
policeman, always courteous and polite, constantly gives
way, stepping on one side until the time comes when
the sailor, puffed and worn out, gives a terrific lunge;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
the policeman gives him a slight impetus, and the sailor
sprawls in an ungainly attitude on the ground. He is
then led off triumphantly by a small piece of string
attached to his belt behind.</p>

<p class="caption">THE VENICE OF JAPAN</p></div>

<p>It was not until I arrived in Osaka, the Venice of
Japan, that I gave up dreaming and seriously began to
work. Here was scope indeed! Osaka is the city of
furnaces, factories, and commerce,&mdash;the centre of the
modern spirit of feverish activity in manufacturing and
commercial enterprise. Western ugliness has invaded
certain quarters; yet the artistic feeling predominates.
The Ajikawa is still the Ajikawa of the olden time, and
on the eastern side of the city is the Kizugawa, into
which&mdash;thanks to the shallowness of the bar&mdash;no steamer
ever intrudes, while the city itself is intersected by a
vast network of canals and waterways, all teeming with
junks and barges, and crossed by graceful wooden
bridges which lend themselves admirably to line. The
Kizugawa fascinates the painter. Away from the bustle
of the factories and the shrieking of the whistles, the
great junks from northern Hakodate or the sunny
Loochos lie sleepily silent. They are the Leviathans
of their kind. Intermingling with them are innumerable
barges and fishing-boats, stretching far up the river,
their masts and cordage seeming one vast spider&rsquo;s web.
Not a single vessel is painted&mdash;from the huge sea-going
junk to the narrow-prowed barge. Near the water-line
the wood has taken a silvery tone; but above, it looks
in the sunlight like light gold. And the cargoes of
rice in straw bales, piled high over the bulwarks, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
also golden. A steam-launch has in tow half a dozen
barges, which, with their unpainted woodwork, rice
bales, and straw-coloured connecting cable, appear
against the dark water as a knotted golden thread. In
the endless perspective of junks the golden tone predominates;
but it is relieved by the colouring of the
buildings on the river banks. There is no monotony,
for no two houses are similar either in tint or in design;
and there is no stiffness of line. The builders are all
artists, to whose instincts repetition would do violence.
The quaint roofs, although formed in straight lines,
seem to rise and fall in gentle undulations. There is
nothing abrupt or rugged; nothing jars. And the
colours are as varied as the roofs. In the upper reaches
of the rivers the scenes never cease to charm. Clusters
of half a dozen boats forming a mass of decorative
woodwork, tea-houses with tiny gardens running down
to the water&rsquo;s edge and gaily-dressed geishas leaning
over the trellised verandahs, light bridges thrown in
graceful outline against the purple horizon,&mdash;all combine
to complete a picture as broad as a study by Rembrandt,
as infinite in detail as a masterpiece by Hobbema.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>THE GARDENS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> is not easy to describe the fascination of a Japanese
garden. Chiefly it is due to studied neglect of geometrical
design. The toy summer-houses dotted here
and there, the miniature lakes, and the tiny bridges
crossing miniature streams, give an air of indescribable
quaintness. Yet, in spite of the smallness of the
dimensions, the first impression is one of vastness.
&ldquo;Who discovers that nothingness is law&mdash;such a one
hath wisdom,&rdquo; says the old Buddhist text. That is
the wisdom the Japanese gardener seeks, for he also is
an artist. There is no one point on which the eye
fastens, and the absence of any striking feature creates a
sense of immensity. It is a broad scheme, just as broad
as a picture by Velasquez would be, and of infinite
detail. It is only accidentally that one discovers the
illusion&mdash;the triumph of art over space. I saw a dog
walk over one of the tiny bridges, and it seemed of
enormous height, so that I was staggered at its bulk
in proportion to the garden; yet it was but an animal
of ordinary size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:487px; height:630px" src="images/img198.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN IRIS GARDEN</p></div>

<p>A Japanese gardener spends his whole life in studying
his trade, and just as earnestly and just as comprehensively
as a doctor would study medicine. I was once
struck by seeing a little man sitting on a box outside
a silk-store on a bald plot of ground. For three
consecutive days I saw this little man sitting on the
same little box, for ever smiling and knocking out the
ash from his miniature pipe. All day long he sat there,
never moving, never talking&mdash;he seemed to be doing
nothing but smoking and dreaming. On the third day
I pointed this little man out to the merchant who
owned the store, and asked what the little man was
doing and why he sat there. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinking,&rdquo; said
the merchant. &ldquo;Yes; but why must he think on that
bald plot of ground? What is he going to do?&rdquo; I
asked, perplexed. The merchant gazed at me in
astonishment, mingled with pity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;he is one of our greatest landscape gardeners,
and for three days he has been thinking out a garden
for me?&mdash;If you care to come here in a few days,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;I will show you the drawings for that
garden all completed.&rdquo; I came in a few days, and I
was shown the most exquisite set of drawings it has
ever been my good fortune to behold. What a garden
it would be! There were full-grown trees, stepping-stones,
miniature bridges, ponds of goldfish&mdash;all
presenting an appearance of vastness, yet in reality
occupying an area the size of a small room. And not
only was the garden itself planned out and designed,
but it was also arranged to form a pattern in relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
to the trees and the houses and the surrounding hills.
This little old man, without stirring from his box or
making a single note, had in those three days created
this garden in his mind&rsquo;s eye, and on returning home
had sketched out the final arrangement. The merchant
told me that his garden would be completed in a few
weeks, with full-grown trees flourishing in it, and
everything planted&mdash;all but one stone, which in all
probability would be there in a few weeks, while, on
the other hand, it might not be placed there for years.
On inquiring as to the reason of this strange delay I
was told that that one particular stone, though insignificant
and unnoticeable in our eyes, occupies a very
prominent position, and that upon the proper placing
and quality of it the beauty and perfection of a Japanese
garden almost entirely depend. Sometimes hundreds
and even thousands of dollars are paid for a large stone
that happens to be rightly proportioned and of the correct
texture of ruggedness to occupy a certain position in a
Japanese garden.</p>

<p>To see the cherry-blossoms of Yoshino, the plum-trees
in full bloom at Sugata, the wistaria at Uyeno, or
the iris at Horikiri, the people will travel scores of
miles. Then, there is the spacious embankment of the
Sumidagawa, at the part known as Mukojima, celebrated
for its avenue of cherry-trees. Before the Restoration
it was the favourite promenade for the daimio and their
retainers, and very picturesque it must have been to
see the stately nobles in their gorgeous robes, saluting
one another with all the grave ceremonial in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
courtiers delighted. The costumes have vanished; but
the ancient residences, with their private waterway
approaches to the river, remain; and the avenue is
still the fashionable promenade.</p>

<p>But it is the iris gardens at Horikiri seen by night
that have left an impression which will never fade from
my mind. We visited the gardens frequently; but
it is one particular visit that I remember above all the
others. Leaving the Hotel Metropole late in the
afternoon, the ricksha men took us at a rattling pace
through the city. After an hour&rsquo;s run we found
ourselves far away from the river in the midst of
uninviting rice-fields, with a glimpse of the gardens in
the distance&mdash;a blue and white oasis in a waste of
green. If one visits the gardens in the afternoon the
changes that the flowers undergo are marvellous. In
the full warm rays of the sun, the great petals, turning
back towards their stems, are rich and glowing in every
shade. Then, as evening comes on and the sunlight
fades, the deeper purple blooms lose their richness and
grow shadowy, while the white ones take on an icy
purity that seems unearthly in its transparency, and
they shine as with an internal light. Still a little later,
and with the last rays of daylight, all the darker flowers
have disappeared, and where a short time ago stood
a proud bed of royal colour one can see only the
ghastly heads of the pure white petals looming like
phantom flowers in the purple night.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:496px" src="images/img202.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A SUNNY GARDEN</p></div>

<p>The effect of the picture was heightened by the
atmospheric colouring. As the silver evening gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
changed to purple night&mdash;a purple only seen in Japan&mdash;the
festoons of lanterns which illuminated the
summer-houses became of one colour with the landscape,
and then, as the night darkened to a deeper
purple, the lights changed to bright orange. It would
be impossible to put such colours on canvas: the only
way to represent them would be by precious stones.
We dined in one of the summer-houses off dainty
plates served us by little musmés while seated on the
white mats. The blooms of the iris appeared softly
luminous, emitting a ghostly light. It is this spiritual
beauty which makes the flowers such a favourite in
temple gardens, and inspires the Japanese to poetry.
On the edge of a tiny lake, approached by a winding
walk, through an avenue of bamboo trellis-work, was
a small shed with a quaint roof. In the shed the
model of a junk was placed. Near it were ink and
small strips of paper. The junk was designed to receive
poems on the beauty of the iris and of the garden.</p>

<p>Nothing disturbs in a Japanese landscape. It is
the harmonic combination of untouched naturalness
and high artistic cultivation. The tea-houses owe
much of their charm to the absence of paint. The
benches, lintels, the posts, are uncoloured, except by age.
The white mats and the paper screens act as a foil to the
bright flashes of the musmés&mdash;waiting-girls&mdash;who move
noiselessly through the rooms like gigantic butterflies
flitting to and fro. The iris blooms are a rich mass
of colour of blue and white, and the gardener has
exhausted his art in pruning all the unnecessary growths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
without leaving a trace of his handiwork. The ride
back was delightful. Tokio at night is seen at its best;
the river is then more fascinating. Huge junks, with
a solitary light at the masthead, glide by&mdash;fantastic
shadows in the purple haze. The tea-houses, with their
festoons of lanterns and orange interiors, in which one
caught glimpses of singing girls in their brilliant
dresses, gleamed like golden patches in the cool purple.
The bridges sparkled with lights; the shops were
bright with colour; and all through the city, to enjoy
the coolness of the night air, groups of citizens were
seated in the streets chattering as gaily and as light-heartedly
as only the Japs can.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>FLOWER ARRANGEMENT</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">One</span> of the chief characteristics of the Japanese, which
especially distinguishes them from Europeans, is their
intense fondness for flowers&mdash;not the fondness which
many English people affect, but an instinctive love of
the beautiful, and a poetical appreciation of symbolism.
The Japanese nature is artistic in essence, and in no
more delightful manner is the art of the people expressed
than in the cultivation of flowers. Flowers to them are
a source of infinite and unending joy, of which the chief
pleasure lies in their proper placing and arrangement.
Every common Japanese workman, every fan-worker or
metal-worker, has some little flower carefully placed
beside him at his work; he loves and prunes and cares
for it.</p>

<p>If you dine out with a friend you will be seated, not
on the right-hand side of the past-middle-age lady
of the house, but near some beautiful flower. The
&ldquo;honoured interior&rdquo; would never have the presumption
to seat you next herself. You are her guest, and must
be made happy by being placed in the near neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
of the principal and most beautiful object in the
room, which is invariably the arrangement of flowers.
And a vase of flowers in a Japanese house is at once a
picture and a poem, being always in perfect harmony
with the surroundings. The art of arranging flowers
is an exact science, in the study of which seven years of
constant hard work finds a man but fairly proficient.
In fact, to create a really fine arrangement is just as
difficult as to paint an equally fine picture. Every leaf
and every flower has to be drawn and practically
modelled into form, while even so simple a thing as the
bending of a twig requires much care and knowledge.
To become a master in the art of flower-arrangement
a man must study for at least fourteen years, devoting
the remainder of his life to perfecting and improving it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:489px" src="images/img212.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A WISTARIA GARDEN</p></div>

<p>There are scores of different arrangements that one
must learn, and volumes upon volumes of designs,
showing all the most delicate and subtle forms of
placing which a master, in order to create perfect balance,
must have at his fingers&rsquo; ends. These ancient designs
are so perfect that it is almost impossible to change
them or to insert any original work into them. Here
and there, indeed, some great master will make a slight
variation in the arrangement of a particular flower, and
in a very short time that variation is trumpeted throughout
the country and known in all art sections. To a
Westerner this seems incredible. He affirms that if he
jumbles a bunch of flowers together in a vase he can
create a different effect every time. Very probably,
and he can also strew roses and cut flowers all over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
dining-table if he likes; but he will still be creating
nothing more than a jumble. If he were to think out
the arrangement of his table from an artistic point of
view as a bit of decoration, he would find it impossible
to produce such a wealth of inartistic variety. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
argues the uninitiated Westerner, &ldquo;these roses strewn
carelessly over our tables, and bunches of flowers stuck
loosely into vases, are far more natural than the single
stiff bough of blossom of Japanese decoration. Flowers
grow in Nature carelessly and wildly, and therefore they
must be arranged to look like that.&rdquo; Now, it is always
difficult to answer these people, for the dining-table of
the West begins by being utterly hopeless in decoration
and in colour. One cannot possibly compare this
meaningless attire, this independent mass of colour
forming no pattern, and probably placed upon the table
by a servant without care or thought, and with an
utter disregard to form and order,&mdash;one cannot compare
such decoration with the beautiful, scientifically-thought-out
flower arrangements of Japan. All that one can
say is that one is art and the other is not. Nature
grabbed at in this crude Western fashion and stuck into
a vase is no longer Nature.</p>

<p>Consummate naturalness is brought about only by
consummate art, and is not the result of accident. If
a bough of blossom growing in the midst of other trees
is taken from Nature and placed in a vase, however
beautiful it might originally have been, it must necessarily
appear awkward and out of place. One of the chief
characteristics of Japanese flower arrangement is its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
resemblance to the flowers in a state of nature. A
bough or a tree in a Japanese room looks exactly like
a real bit of Nature lifted bodily out of the sunshine
and its own particular surroundings, and placed there.
Nature appears to be almost commonplace as compared
with the work of a great Japanese master in the art of
flower arrangement, and almost less natural. A master,
after having received a clear impression of the way a
certain bough appears in the midst of its background of
Nature, is capable of taking that single bough and of
twisting it into broad beautiful lines, one picking up
with the other in such a way as to convey the same
impression to you as it did when growing in its own
sunny garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:494px; height:630px" src="images/img216.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FLOWER-PLACING</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;But why are there so few flowers in this
Japanese method of flower decoration?&rdquo; complains
the Westerner. &ldquo;Why only one branch of blossom
in a pot?&mdash;why only one?&rdquo; Because you can see
that one and enjoy it, provided that you have the
capacity to see at all, which the majority of people
have not. One beautiful bough or one beautiful
picture should be ample food for enjoyment to last
an artist for one whole day. If there were twenty
beautiful boughs, or twenty beautiful pictures, you
would look from one to the other and would necessarily
become confused. You would leave that room
feeling thoroughly unhappy, and with the same sort
of headache that one gets after spending an afternoon
in a picture-gallery. To enjoy one of these pictures
or flowers, and to concentrate one&rsquo;s thoughts upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
it alone, you would have to frame it between your
hands, cutting it off and isolating it from the rest.</p>

<p>This the Japanese do for you. They know that
you cannot appreciate more than one beautiful object
at a time, and they see that that one object is perfectly
placed in relation to its surroundings, so as to give
rest and enjoyment to the eye. Almost every one in
Japan, either young or old, is capable of appreciating
a fine arrangement of flowers, and nearly every Japanese
woman can practise the art.</p>

<p>So many minute descriptions have already been
written of the methods of the masters of flower
decoration that there is little else to say on that point.
However, since decoration by flowers has so much
to do with the art of the country, and is so closely
connected with the character of the people, I feel
that I must give a slight description of some of the
marvellous creations in purple irises, lilies, and pines
that the greatest master in Tokio once arranged for
me at my hotel. He arrived early one morning, and
in great good-humour, evidently feeling that, I being
an artist, his work would be appreciated and understood.
He carried with him his flowers, tenderly
wrapped in a damp cloth under one arm, and his
vases under another. One of his most promising
pupils, a girl of nineteen, accompanied him, acting
almost as a servant and evidently worshipping him as
her master. He began at once to show us a decoration
of lilies and reeds. With the utmost rapidity
he took out a bunch of slim reeds, pulled them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
different lengths, the large ones at the back, the small
ones in front, and caressed the whole into a wooden
prong looking like a clothes-peg, and arranged it in
a kind of vase made out of a circular section of bamboo.
An immense amount of care was taken with the handling
of these reeds, the master drawing back now and
then in a stooping position with his hands on his knees
and his eyes bolting out to view his handiwork critically.
Next he took some lilies with their leaves, and
arranged them in a metal stand composed of a number
of divisions looking like cartridge-cases cut off. Every
leaf was twisted and bent and cut to improve its form.
The half-open lilies were made to look as though they
were growing, and were a great favourite with this
master because of the scope for beautiful curves and
lines that they allowed. Time after time he would
take out a leaf or a flower, putting another in its place,
thereby showing that he had absolute command over
his subject, and a fixed picture in his mind that he
was determined to produce at any cost. The ultimate
result of the decoration was perfect naturalness. I
never saw lilies growing on the hillside look more
natural than they did here; yet each had been twisted
and bent into a set design laid down by the artist.
Both reeds and lilies were placed in a wooden tray
partially lacquered, the unlacquered portion representing
old worm-eaten wood; pebbles were placed in the
bottom of the tray, and the whole was flooded with
water. Then he began his decoration of irises. He
took a bundle of iris leaves, cut and trimmed them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
washing and drying each leaf separately, and sticking
them together in groups of twos and threes. With his
finger and thumb he gently pressed each one down
the centre, rendering it as pliable as wire. The leaves
were cut to a point at the base and placed in a
metal stand with consecutive circles. Then an iris
bud, with the purple just bursting, was placed in
position and caressed into bloom. The whole was
syringed with water and carefully placed in a corner
of the room.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:486px" src="images/img220.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WISTARIA</p></div>

<p>I have described these few flower arrangements in
detail in order to show the exactitude of the work and the
immense amount of care taken by professors in flower
arrangement. On this particular occasion I had invited
some friends to enjoy the professor&rsquo;s masterpieces with
me, and he had just completed a most exquisite production,
by far the best and finest he had achieved
that day. It was an arrangement of pine with one
great jutting bough, perfectly balanced&mdash;in fact, a
veritable work of art. The professor was a true
artist; he loved his work, and it was all the world
to him.</p>

<p>For once he was content, and had just leant back
to view his work through half-closed eyes when in
a flash an Oxford straw hat was clapped down right
on top of it. It was the husband of one of my friends
just returned from a walk, full of spirits and boisterously
happy. It was a cruel thing to do; but he did not
realise the horror of his act. He saw a bough sticking
right out of a pot, and it seemed to him a suitable place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
to hang his hat on: so he hung it there&mdash;that was all.
The little assistant gave one frightened look at her
master, and began to pack up the utensils at once; the
professor drew himself up in a very dignified way,
bowed profoundly, and left the hotel. I never saw
him again, and I knew that I never should&mdash;for he
went away crushed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>THE GEISHA</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">With</span> all their practical gifts&mdash;which, as one of themselves
has remarked, will enable them to beat the world
with the tips of their fingers&mdash;and all the power of
assimilating and adapting to their own purposes the
best that other nations have to offer them,&mdash;the Japanese
are essentially and beyond all a nation of artists. It
is not only in the work-shop and the studio, but also
in the simplest act and detail of daily life, that this
sense of the decorative oozes unconsciously forth, and
most of all, and most unconsciously, in the Japanese
woman&mdash;the geisha.</p>

<p>The <i>raison d&rsquo;être</i> of the geisha is to be decorative.
She delights in her own delightsomeness; she wants
frankly to be as charming as nature and art will allow;
she wants to be beautiful; and she honestly and assuredly
wants me and you and the stranger artists to think her
beautiful. She wants to please you, and she openly
sets about pleasing, taking you into her confidence
(so to speak) as to her methods. She does it with
the simple joy and sincerity of a child dressing up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
There is no mock shyness, no fan put up, no screen
drawn, no pathetic struggle to deceive you into belief
in the reality of an all-too-artificial peach-bloom;
there is nothing of the British scheme&mdash;no powder-puff
hidden in a pocket-handkerchief, no little ivory
box with a looking-glass in the lid, no rouge-tablet
concealed in a muff to be supplied surreptitiously at
some propitious moment. The Japanese woman has
the courage to look upon her face purely as so
much surface for decoration, a canvas upon which
to paint a picture; and she decorates it as one might
decorate a bit of bare wall. The white is simple
vegetable white; the red is pure vermilion toning
with her kimono. The white makes no effort to blend
with the natural tone of her neck: it announces itself
in a clear-cut, knife-edge pattern above the folds of
the kimono.</p>

<p class="caption">BUTTERFLIES</p></div>

<p>I remember a little story that I once heard (it
was told me by the designer of the waterworks in
Tokio)&mdash;only a trifling incident; but it struck me as
being thoroughly typical of the naïve, almost childish
simplicity of the Japanese woman. It was on the
day that the waterworks were completed, and the
high officials and their wives were being escorted over
the works in trucks, in order that they might see
and admire this great engineering feat, of which my
friend, the architect, was very justly proud. There
were two trucks&mdash;one for the men and one for their
wives. The truck containing the men was wheeled
up under a shaft where the light came down from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
above, and enabled the officials to look up and admire
this great work. The men looked up and were duly
impressed, and altogether the experiment passed off
successfully. Then the idea was that they should
move aside so as to allow the women also to enjoy
the spectacle. No sooner was the truck-load of
women drawn up beneath the shaft than their faces
lit up with pleased surprise, and every woman whipped
out a looking-glass and a rouge-pot and began to
decorate her face. Not one of them looked up, or
even attempted to take the slightest notice of the
waterworks: all they knew was that it afforded them
just sufficient light by which to decorate themselves,
and they promptly made use of it.</p>

<p>The geisha is the educated woman of Japan. She
is the entertainer, the hostess; she is highly educated,
and has a great appreciation of art; she is also proficient
in the art of conversation. The geisha begins her
career at a very early age. When only two or three
years old she is taught to sing and dance and talk,
and above all to be able to listen sympathetically, which
is the greatest art of all. The career of this tiny
mite is carved out thus early because her mother foresees
that she has the qualities that will develop, and
the little butterfly child, so gay and so brilliant,
will become a still more gorgeous butterfly woman.
Nothing can be too brilliant for the geisha; she is the
life and soul of Japan, the merry sparkling side of
Japanese life; she must be always gay, always laughing
and always young, even to the end of her life. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
for the girl who is to become the ordinary domesticated
wife it is different. Starting life as a bright, light-hearted
little child, she becomes sadder and sadder in
colour and in spirits with every passing year. Directly
she becomes a wife her one ambition is to become old&mdash;in
fact, it is almost a craze with her. She shows it
in every possible way&mdash;in the way she ties her obi,
the fashion in which she dresses her hair; everything
that suggests the advance of the sere and yellow leaf
she will eagerly adopt. When her husband gives a
party he calls in the geisha; she herself, poor dear,
sits upstairs on a mat and is not allowed to be seen.
She is called the &ldquo;honoured interior,&rdquo; and is far too
precious and refined to figure in public life. But, mind
you, this little married lady, the &ldquo;honoured interior,&rdquo;
does not ignore her personal appearance altogether: she
too will never miss an opportunity to whip out the
rouge-pot and mirror that always form part of every
Japanese woman&rsquo;s attire in order to decorate her face.
And although to our eyes she appears a nonentity
as compared with the geisha, her position is in reality
a very happy one and greatly to be envied. What
if the geisha entertain her husband&rsquo;s guests? Hers is
the greater privilege of attending upon him when he
returns, tired out from the festivities; she is as a rare
jewel set in the background of her home, and the
&ldquo;honoured interior&rdquo; is perfectly content.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:491px" src="images/img232.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DAUGHTERS OF THE SUN</p></div>

<p>But the idiotic idea so general in the West, that
the geisha is a silly giggling little girl with a fan,
must really be corrected, although I can quite understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
how this opinion has been formed. The geisha
in reality is a little genius, perfectly brilliant as a
talker, and mistress of the art of dancing. But she
knows that the Westerner does not appreciate or
understand her fine classical dancing and singing,
and she is so refined and so charming that she will
not allow you to feel that you are ignorant and more
or less vulgar, but will instantly begin to amuse you in
some way that she thinks you will enjoy and understand.
She will perhaps unfold paper and draw rapid character-sketches
of birds and fish, or dance a sort of spirited
dance that she feels will entertain you. It is very
seldom that they will show you their fine classical
dances; but if by good fortune you can over-persuade
them, as I have done, the sight is one that you will
never forget&mdash;the slow, dignified movements, the
placing of the foot and the hand, the exquisite curves
and poses of the body, forming a different picture every
time,&mdash;all is a joy and a perfect intellectual treat to the
artist and to the lover of beautiful things. There is no
rushing about, no accordion skirt and high kick, nothing
that in any way resembles the Western dance.</p>

<p>Sometimes, if she finds that you appreciate the
fine work, the geisha will give you imitations of the
dancing on our stage at home, and although it is
very funny, the coarseness of it strikes you forcibly.
One never dines out or is entertained in Japan without
the geisha forming a prominent part of the entertainment;
in fact, she herself decorates the room where
you are dining, just as a flower or a picture would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
decorate our dining-rooms at home, only better. And
there is nothing more typical of the decorative sense
innate in the Japanese than the little garden of geisha
girls, which almost invariably forms the background of
every tea-house dinner. The dinner itself, with its
pretty doll-tables, its curious assortment of dainty
viands set in red lacquer bowls, its quaint formalities,
and the magnificent ceremonial costumes of its hosts,
is an artistic scheme, elaborately thought out and prepared.
But when, at the close, the troupe of geishas
and maïkos appears, forming (as it were) a pattern
of gorgeous tropical flowers, the scene becomes a
bit of decoration as daring, original, and whimsically
beautiful as any to be seen in the land of natural
&ldquo;placing&rdquo; and artistic design and effect. The colours
of kimonos, obis, fans, and head-ornaments blend, contrast,
and produce a carefully-arranged harmony, the
whole converging to a centre of attraction, a grotesque,
fascinating, exotic figure, the geisha of geishas&mdash;that
vermilion-and-gold girl who especially seizes me. She
is a bewildering symphony in vermilion, orange, and
gold. Her kimono is vermilion embroidered in great
dragons; her obi is cloth of gold; her long hanging
sleeves are lined with orange. Just one little slim slip
of apple-green appears above the golden fold of the obi
and accentuates the harmony; it is the crape cord of
the knapsack which bulges the loops at the back and
gives the Japanese curve of grace. The little apple-green
cord keeps the obi in its place, and is the discord
which makes the melody.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:496px" src="images/img236.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERNS</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
My vermilion girl&rsquo;s hair is brilliant black with blue
lights, and shining where it is stiffened and gummed in
loops and bands till they seem to reflect the gold lacquer
and coral-tipped pins that bristle round her head. Yes,
she is like some wonderful fantastical tropical blossom,
that vermilion geisha-girl, or like some hitherto unknown
and gorgeous dragon-fly. And she is charming;
so sweetly, simply, candidly alluring. Every movement
and gesture, each rippling laugh, each fan-flutter, each
wave of her rice-powdered arms from out of their wing-like
sleeves, is a joyous and naïve appeal for admiration
and sympathy. How impossible to withhold either!
The geisha-girl is an artist: I am an artist: we understand
each other.</p>

<p>My geisha-girl brings out her dainty lacquer-box,
and under the gaze of all sits down to decorate herself
with a frank joy in the pleasure she knows she is going
to give. And she knows too what she is about. She
knows the value of a tone in a lip. Something suggests
to her that you, an artist, may have found the vermilion
lip not quite in harmony with the plan, and she changes
it to bronze. Three times this evening does my geisha-girl
change her lip; she frankly takes it off with a little
bit of rice-paper, which she rolls up and tucks into the
folds of her kimono, to be thrown away later, and the
bronze lip is substituted. By and by it seems to occur
to her that the bronze lip has become monotonous,
and she will change it again to vermilion. No doubt
before the evening is over there will be a series of little
bits of rice-paper folded away ready to be got rid of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
when the bill is paid, the supper eaten, and the festival
at an end.</p>

<p>It is through the geisha-girls that there is still a living
art in Japan at the present day in the designs of the silk
dresses that they wear. They are so modern, so up-to-date,
and yet so characteristic of Japan. The women
are very extravagant in their dress, and some of the
leading geisha-girls will often go to the length of having
stencils, with elaborate designs and an immense amount
of hand-work, specially cut for them, the stencils and
designs being destroyed when sufficient material for one
dress has been supplied. For such a unique and costly
gown the geisha will of course have to pay a fabulous
sum, and a sum that would astound the average English
woman of fashion. But then when a geisha orders a
costume she thinks it out carefully; she does not go, as
we do, to a dressmaker, but to an artist. It may be
that she has a fancy for apple-blossom at sunset, and this
idea she talks out with the artist who is to draw the
designs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:496px" src="images/img240.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A STREET SCENE, KIOTO</p></div>

<p>A Japanese woman chooses her costumes, not according
to fashion but to some sentiment or other&mdash;apple-blossom
because it is spring-time, peach-blossom for a
later season,&mdash;and many beautiful ideas are thus expressed
in the gowns of the women of Japan. But although
the geisha has plenty of latitude in which to display her
artistic feeling, there are some little details of etiquette
and fashion that she must adhere to, which show
themselves in a few details of the Japanese women&rsquo;s
attire, as, for example, in the thongs of her little wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
shoes and the decoration of her jet-black hair. Not
only is the kimono of the geisha, its colour and design,
thought out by the artist, but all the accessories of her
toilette, such as the obi, the fan, and the ornaments for
her hair. It is the artist&rsquo;s ambition that she should be
a picture, perfect in every detail, and the geisha is
always a picture, beautiful beyond description.</p>

<p>How different she is from the geisha of fiction, of
operettas, and of story-books, which is the only geisha
that the stay-at-home Englishman can know! That she
is beautiful to look at all the world agrees; but quite
apart from her beauty, or the social position that she
happens to occupy in Japan, take her as a woman, a
real woman, stripped of all outward appearances and of
her own particular nationality&mdash;take her as a woman,
and she will be found as dainty in mind as in appearance,
highly educated, and with a great sense of honour,
while her moral code would compare favourably with
others of her sex all the world over.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>CHILDREN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">A cluster</span> of little Japanese children at play somehow
suggests to me a grand picture-gallery, a picture-gallery
of a nation. Every picture is a child upon which has
been expended the subtle decorative sense of its family
or neighbours, as expressed in the tint of its dress and
sash and in the decoration of its little head. It is in
the children that the national artistic and poetic nature
of the Japanese people most assuredly finds expression.
Each little one expresses in its tiny dress some conception,
some idea or thought, dear to the mother, some
particular aspect of the national ideals. And just as in
the West the character of a man can be gauged by the
set and crease of his trousers, so in Japan are the sentiments
and ideals of a mother expressed in the design
and colouring of her baby&rsquo;s little kimono. Thus, when
watching a group of children, maybe on a fête day, one
instinctively compares them with a gallery of pictures,
each of which is a masterpiece, painted by an artist
whose individuality is clearly expressed therein. Each
little picture in this gallery of children is perfect in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
itself; yet on closer study it will be found that the
children are more than mere pictures. They tell us
of the truths of Japan.</p>

<p>One child, in the clearness and freshness of its dress,
seems to embody an expression of that unselfish cheerfulness
so characteristic of the Japanese, among whose
children you can go for days without seeing one cry.
Another, in the graceful dignity and rich yet severe
colouring of its costume, tells of that faithful spirit of
loyalty and pride that has always marked the lives of
the Japanese. One tiny baby, in the dainty sombreness
of colour and quiet arrangement of the folds of its little
kimono, suggests the thoughtful consideration and sweet
seriousness of the women of Japan; and another child,
dressed in a wonderful combination of red and bronze
relieved by glimpses of white, expresses in its rich glowing
colour, and the purity of the white within, the fire
of Japanese patriotism.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:497px; height:630px" src="images/img248.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BABY AND BABY</p></div>

<p>But come with me for a walk on any day, in sun or
in rain, whether on a gala day or on an ordinary day,
and we shall meet little units in the decorative whole,
every one of them a colour picture bringing to the
mind some characteristic of the people. We shall find
one little one who, to the eye of the artist, flashes like
a gem, her white kimono, decorated, or rather made
vivid, as by the hand of a master, with only three or
four great black crosses, each formed of the crisp
dexterous drags across the surface of the cloth. Again
the black is repeated in the carefully-arranged hair, and
the white in the little wooden shoes; but all is toned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
and touched by just a little old rose in the ribbon that
ties her head-dress and the fastening of the thongs at
her feet.</p>

<p>Such an art in a people is living; it has its root in
national spirit and national character, and must continue
to foster and strengthen the national ideals.</p>

<p>The clothing of her children is a matter of great
and serious consideration to the Japanese mother.
When a baby is born she gathers together all her
friends, and they discuss a scheme of decoration for
the set of miniature dresses that the little one is to
wear. More care is taken with these baby dresses
than with those of any grown person, and if the
parents are rich the sums that are spent on silk crepe
are sometimes such as would shock any English mother.
So much has to be taken into consideration with regard
to the design of a child&rsquo;s dress: it might be cherry-blossom
or a landscape, according to the month and the
circumstances amid which the infant was born. The
colouring of the costume is generally suggestive of the
ideas and sentiments of the mother. She does not say,
&ldquo;I will take this bough of apple-blossom, and it shall be
the dress of my child,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will take Fuji at sunset,
and the colouring of my baby&rsquo;s dress shall be of old
rose and white snow.&rdquo; She does not grab at nature in
this crude way; but the artistic and poetical feelings
innate in her unconsciously find expression in the little
frock. When the mother and her neighbours have
finally decided upon a scheme of decoration, the designs
are placed in the hands of some great artist, who carries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
them out in water-colour drawings on silk, which the
friends gather together again to examine and generally
enjoy. Then the designs are handed over to some
expert stencil-cutter, go through the regular elaborate
course, and are finally retouched, by the artist himself,
directly on to the silk. If the parents are rich enough
the stencils are destroyed, and the dress consequently
becomes unique. Such a dress will doubtless be an
exquisite work of art, and very costly. Indeed, a dress
for a Japanese baby can cost quite as much as a picture
by a leading Academician, and is of far greater artistic
value. But no price can be too great, no colouring too
gorgeous, for the dresses of these little butterflies, the
children of Japan. The poorest mother will scrape
together sufficient money, and the father sacrifice one
half of his daily portion of rice, in order that a child
may attend a festival in the bright hues befitting its age.
The younger the child, the more brilliant is its dress.
You will see a mite, a little baby girl that cannot
walk or talk, clothed in silk crepe of the most brilliant
colour possible&mdash;rainbow colour, almost prismatic in its
brilliancy. As the child grows older the colours fade,
and become duller, until by the time she is a full-grown
woman they have sobered down almost to Quaker hues&mdash;except
here and there, where some tiny edging of
colour shows itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:497px; height:630px" src="images/img252.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A JAP IN PLUM-COLOUR</p></div>

<p>The science of deportment occupies quite half the
time of the Japanese children&rsquo;s lives, and so early are
they trained that even the baby of three, strapped
to the back of its sister aged five, will in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
awkward position bow to you and behave with perfect
propriety and grace. This Japanese baby has already
gone through a course of severe training in the science
of deportment. It has been taught how to walk, how
to kneel down, and how to get up again without disarranging
a single fold of its kimono. After this it
is necessary that it should learn the correct way to
wait upon people&mdash;how to carry a tray, and how to
present it gracefully; while the dainty handing of a
cup to a guest is of the greatest importance imaginable.
A gentleman can always tell the character of a girl and
the class to which she belongs by the way she offers
him a cup of Sake. And then the children are taught
that they must always control their feelings&mdash;if they
are sad, never to cry; if they are happy, to laugh
quietly, never in a boisterous manner, for that would
be considered vulgar in the extreme.</p>

<p>Modesty and reserve are insisted upon in the youth
of Japan. A girl is taught that she must talk very
little, but listen sympathetically to the conversation of
her superiors. If she has a brother, she must look
up to him as her master, even although he be younger
than herself. She must give way to him in every
detail. The baby boy places his tiny foot upon his
sister&rsquo;s neck, and she is thenceforth his slave. If he
is sad, her one care must be to make him happy. Her
ambition is to imitate as nearly as possible the behaviour
of her mother towards her own lord and master.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made by enterprising
Westerners to &ldquo;broaden&rdquo; the minds of the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
girls, and to make them more independent, by establishing
schools for them, where they can be educated on
purely Western principles; but these attempts have
always failed. The women turned out from such establishments
are always unhappy, and continue to suffer
for the rest of their lives, because they are disliked and
resented by all their people, and no man will marry any
of them. The beautiful side of life seems to have been
taken from them; imagination is crushed and spoilt;
they are unfitted for the life that every Japanese woman
must lead. Naturally they are hated by the men, for
the womanly qualities that are most valuable in a
Japanese girl are destroyed by this Western &ldquo;broadening&rdquo;
of their minds: they wear high-heeled shoes, put
nosegays on the table, and are altogether demoralised.
Sad to say, Western influence is keenly felt within
the schools which belong to all classes and conditions
of Japanese children, and one trembles lest gradually
the simplicity and quaint formality of their bringing-up
should become hardened and roughened into the system
which has done so much to spoil the child-life of the
West. Their own artistic training is perfect; and
although Japan is the land of ceremony, and the
children are brought up with a certain strictness of
propriety unknown in the less ceremonious West,
their utter naturalness and absolute freedom from
seeking after effects present in them a simplicity of
character which helps to make them the most delightful
of their kind. A little boy flying a kite is like no
other boy you have ever seen in England. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
is a curious formality and staidness about him and
his companions which never degenerates into shyness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:490px; height:630px" src="images/img256.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SUGAR-WATER STALL</p></div>

<p>Once I drifted into a country village in search of
subjects for pictures, and I found to my astonishment
that every living soul there was flying a kite,
from old men down to babies. It was evidently a
fête day, dedicated to kites; all business seemed
abandoned, and every one either stood or ran about,
gazing up in the air at the respective toys. There
were kites of every variety&mdash;red kites, yellow kites,
kites in the shape of fish, teams of fighting kites,
and sometimes whole battalions of them at war with
kites of a different colour, attempting to chafe each
other&rsquo;s strings. It rather surprised me at first to see
staid old men keenly interested in so childish an amusement;
but in a very short time I too found myself
running about with the rest, grasping a string and
watching with the greatest joy imaginable the career
of a floating thing gorgeously painted, softly rising
higher and higher in the air, until it mingled among
the canopy of other kites above my head, becoming
entangled for a moment, then leaving them and soaring
up above the common herd, and side by side with a
monstrous butterfly kite; then came the chase, the
fight, and the downfall of one or the other. They
were all children there, every one of them, from the
old men downwards; all care and worry was for
the time forgotten in the simple joy of flying kites;
and I too, in sympathy with the gaiety about me,
felt bubbling over with pure joy. To see these lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
flower-like child faces mingling with the yellow wrinkled
visages of very old men, all equally happy in a game in
which age played no part, was an experience never to be
forgotten. None was too old or too young, and you
would see mites strapped to the backs of their mothers,
holding a bit of soiled knotted string in their baby
fingers, and gazing with their black slit eyes at some
tiny bit of a crumpled kite floating only a few inches
away.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:494px; height:630px" src="images/img260.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ADVANCE JAPAN</p></div>

<p>Another game in which both the youth and the age
of Japan play equal parts is the game of painting sand-pictures
on the roadside. These sand-pictures are
often executed by very clever artists; but I have
seen little children drawing exquisite pictures in
coloured sands. Japanese children seem to have
an instinctive knowledge of drawing and a facility
in the handling of a paint-brush that is simply extraordinary.
They will begin quite as babies to practise
the art of painting and drawing, and more especially
the art of painting sand-pictures. You will see groups
of little children sitting in the playground of some
ancient temple, each child with three bags of coloured
sand and one of white, competing with one another
as to who shall draw the quaintest and most rapid
picture. The white sand they will first proceed to
spread upon the ground in the form of a square,
cleaning the edges until it resembles a sheet of white
paper. Then, with a handful of black sand held in
the chubby fingers, they will draw with the utmost
rapidity the outline of some grotesque figure of a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
or an animal, formed out of their own baby imaginations.
Then come the coloured sands, filling in the
spaces with red, yellow, or blue, according to the taste
and fancy of the particular child artist. But the most
extraordinary and most fascinating thing of all is to
watch the performance of a master in sand-pictures.
So dexterous and masterly is he that he will dip his
hand first into a bag of blue sand, and then into one
of yellow, allowing the separate streams to trickle out
unmixed; and then with a slight tremble of the hand
these streams will be quickly converted into one thin
stream of bright green, relapsing again into the streams
of blue and yellow at a moment&rsquo;s notice. A Japanese
mother will take infinite pains to cultivate the artistic
propensities of her child, and almost the first lesson
she teaches it is to appreciate the beauties of nature.
She will never miss the opportunity of teaching the
infant to enjoy the cherry-blossom on a sunny day
in Uyeno Park. Hundreds of such little parties are
to be seen under the trees enjoying the blossom, while
the mother, seated in the middle of the group, points
out the many beauties of the scene. She will tell them
dainty fairy stories&mdash;to the boys, brave deeds of
valour, to strengthen their courage; to the girls, tales
of unselfish and honourable wives and mothers. Every
story has a moral attached to it, and is intended to
educate and improve the children in one direction or
another. There is one fairy story which is a universal
favourite with both mothers and children, and that
is the story of Momotaro. When seeing a mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
talking earnestly to her children, I have always discovered
that it was the same old story, old yet ever
fresh. It is a curiously simple tale about an old woman
who goes every day to the river to wash clothes, and
an old man who goes to the mountain to fetch wood.
The old woman is always unhappy because she has
no children, and one day, when she is washing clothes
in the river, a large peach comes floating down towards
her. On carrying it home, she hears the cry of a
child, which appears to come from the inside of the
peach. She rapidly cuts it in two, and finds to her
amazement a fine baby sitting in the middle of it,
which, since it was born in a peach, she afterwards called
Momotaro. The story then goes on to tell how the
baby grows up to be a fine healthy lad, who, on
reaching the age of seventeen, plans an expedition to
subjugate an island of the devil. A minute description
is given of the food he takes with him&mdash;of the corn
and rice wrapped in a bamboo leaf&mdash;and how on
his journey he meets with a wasp, a crab, a chestnut,
and a millstone, who all promise to help him if he
will give them half of his food. The lad complies,
and a beautiful description is given of their journey to
the island of the devil, on which journey a very skilful
plan is thought out by which to kill him. On arriving
at the island, they find that the chief of the devils
is not in his own room. They soon take advantage
of his absence. The chestnut hops into the ash; the
millstone mounts on to the roof; the crab hides in
the washing-pan; the wasp settles in a corner; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
the lad waits outside. The poor devil comes back,
and has a terrible time between them all. He goes
to the fireplace to warm his hands; the chestnut
cracks in the fire and burns them; he rushes to
the water-pan to cool himself, and the crab bites
his hand; he flies to a safe place, and is tormented
by the wasp; in an agony of pain he tries to leave
the room, but the remorseless millstone descends with
a crash upon his head, and mortally wounds him.
This story is told to the Japanese children over and
over again, but is always received with wide-eyed
delight and excitement.</p>

<p class="caption">CHUMS</p></div>

<p>I have never seen a child in Japan cry; nor have
I ever seen one smacked, for what mother can have
the heart to touch so dainty a blossom as the child
flower of this land of flowers? A group of Japanese
children is perhaps the prettiest sight on earth, and
they themselves are works of art, the beauty of which
can scarcely be imagined. Each head and each piquant
face is but a field where the ever-present artist can
exercise his ingenuity and his skill in colour and design.
Deliberately the child&rsquo;s head and face are treated as
subjects fit for the most decorative of design, and the
result, though quaint and formal to the last degree, is
invariably as pleasing as it is undoubtedly startling and
original. And the children themselves are no less full
of interest than their heads and faces are full of paint.
I once saw a pyramid of children gazing in at a sweet-stuff
shop. They looked like three children; but on
closer inspection I discovered that one was a doll looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
about the age of a child of two, with its great head
lolling on the back of its mother, aged three. The
three-year-old was a boy, strapped to the back of his
sister aged five. The doll and the sister looked very
sleepy and tired as they gazed vacantly at the rows
of tempting pink sugar-water bottles in the sweet-stuff
shop; but what arrested my attention was the alert
and intelligent expression of the three-year-old child
in the middle, who, just as I took out my notebook
to sketch the group, put a lighted cigarette between
his lips, holding it between two chubby fingers, eyeing
me with the peculiar introspective look of the old
hand as he both tests the excellence of the tobacco
and gives himself up to its enjoyment. As I sketched
him he looked composedly at me out of his big eyes,
and posed twice without a particle of artificiality&mdash;once
with the cigarette in his mouth, and again as if he
had just taken it from his lips for a moment while he
paid attention to me.</p>

<p class="caption">A SUNNY STROLL</p></div>

<p>I remember once passing a temple, an ancient Shinto
temple called &ldquo;Kamogamo&rdquo;; it was a sacred temple
and very popular, being much frequented for picnics.
On this particular day there was going on one of the
two important picnics or festivals of the year; the
great ground of the temple and the playground were
enclosed about with straw ropes on bamboo poles, to
separate one from another. It was a festival for girls
under ten, and there were hundreds of children, all with
their kimonos tucked up, showing their scarlet petticoats,
and looking for all the world like a mass of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
poppies. The scarlet in the petticoats was universally
repeated in neck and hair; but their kimonos varied
much, and were of almost every shade and texture
of Japanese cloth and silk crepe imaginable. There
were luminous greens, fawns, stripes, golden browns
shading into lemon-yellows, harmonies in brown and
violet, and dresses striped and chequered in tones of
almost every conceivable value. Two rows or armies
of these girls were placed several yards distant from
each other in this long emerald-green field; and in the
space between them stood two servants, each holding a
long bamboo pole, fresh and green, being evidently just
cut down for the fair, and suspending from its top a
flat shallow drum covered with tissue paper. Presently
two young men teachers appeared on the scene carrying
two baskets of small many-coloured balls, which they
threw down on the grass between the children and the
drums. Then a signal was given, and all the girls
started running down the field at full tilt towards one
another, pouncing on the balls as they ran, and throwing
them with all their force up at the paper drums.
The great majority of them missed their aim altogether,
and flew either above or below the drums, some of the
mites getting so excited that they threw the balls
forty or fifty yards in mid air. After a time, when
a perfect shower of balls had passed through the
tissue drums, quite demolishing them, a shower of
coloured papers, miniature lanterns, paper umbrellas,
and flags came slowly fluttering down among the
children on to their jet-black bobbing heads, and into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
their eager outstretched hands. Never have I seen
anything more beautiful than these gay, brightly-clad
people, packed closely together like a cluster of
flowers in the brilliant sparkling sunshine, with their
pretty upturned faces watching the softly falling rain
of coloured toys. I strolled through the temple grounds,
passed this brilliant stream of colour and lovely laughing
children, passed the cherry-trees and dainty tea-houses,
and in a few minutes found myself in a cool grey-green
forest of bamboo, an academic bamboo grove looking
like a pillared temple, sunless and silent. It was here
that the philosophers of old taught and meditated, and
it seemed a place to meditate in&mdash;so quiet, so sombre,
shut off from the world with its endless lofty pillars of
grey luminous green&mdash;silent, a world apart.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>WORKERS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was with a view to decorating my newly-built
London house that I paid a second visit to Japan,
being convinced that it was possible to handle the
labour there at a cheaper rate and with finer results
than in Europe. My experience proved that I was
right. Before leaving England, however, I was carefully
informed by all my friends of the exceedingly
bad reputation that the Japanese have gained commercially.
I was told that they were treacherous
and unscrupulous in their dealings, and that I was,
above all, to beware of the Japanese merchant. As
it happened, it was through making a friend of one
particular little Japanese merchant&mdash;through concentrating
my attention upon him, and studying him
continually&mdash;that I was enabled to gain a real insight
into the life of the people, and to tear away that
impenetrable veil which, to the Westerner&rsquo;s eyes,
always hangs before them.</p>

<p>When you get to know a Japanese merchant well,
a man who has studied our methods, you will find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
that he talks openly and frankly about his dealings
with the European globe-trotter. He will tell you
that he cheats you and charges you high prices
because the average Westerner has got no eye.
The Westerner does not appreciate the really fine and
beautiful articles that the Japanese soul worships;
therefore the merchant gives him what he thinks the
Westerner wants, and asks the price that he thinks
the traveller will give. When we first came into
touch with the Japanese we began by cheating them
and foisting deceptions upon them, and now they
simply turn the tables upon us and cheat us to the
best of their ability. The only difference is that
the Japanese have more intelligence about wrong done
them, and their motive for cheating is thus resentingly
greater. I have had many dealings with the Japanese
myself, and have always found them just. To be
sure, I have never come into touch with the treaty-port
merchants, who have been more or less tainted
by the Westerner; but I have come into touch with,
and studied, the genuine workers of Japan.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:492px; height:630px" src="images/img278.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A LITTLE JAP</p></div>

<p>My first object on arriving in Tokio was to find
some Japanese who would be capable of gathering
together a series of splendid craftsmen to work for
me. As luck would have it, I found my man&mdash;a
perfect little genius of a fellow&mdash;on the evening of
my first day in Japan, and in a most unexpected
manner. I was sitting in the reading-room of the
hotel, with my plans spread out before me, dreaming
of the Japanese glories that were to decorate my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
London house, when my attention was attracted by
seeing a little creature, looking like a monkey with
a great box on his back, bound suddenly into the
room, evidently by aid of the manager&rsquo;s foot in
the adjoining hall. Not in the least perturbed, he
began to unstrap the box from his back, from
which he took out curios, and drifted about the
room trying to sell them to the different globe-trotters
assembled there. Nothing was too small or
too trivial for him: he would sell anything. He
was chivied about, insulted, and abused by every one;
yet he received it all with a smiling face. Nothing
seemed to affect him. He was a typical Japanese,
with bright slit-like eyes set as close together as any
monkey&rsquo;s&mdash;blinking eyes they were, but so intelligent.
I could see that he was a keen observer, and that he
looked upon these wayfarers as so much material of
prey, by the quiet way in which he selected a man
with a big pocket, sidling up to him and allowing himself
to be insulted, yet always getting the best of the
bargain in the end. He tried to sell me some very
bad cloisonné, and he was so clever about it, handling
his wares in so dexterous a manner,&mdash;making his
twopenny-halfpenny pots appear of priceless value&mdash;that
it occurred to me that this little monkey resemblance
might have ideas of his own, and be in some
small way able to help me. He spoke English a
little, and I told him to come up to my room that
night, when I should have something to say to him.
Glancing at me in a searching way, without asking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
a single question or showing the slightest surprise, he
only said, &ldquo;I come!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:487px; height:630px" src="images/img282.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A BY-CANAL</p></div>

<p>And he came. When I went up to my room after
dinner, I found him sitting there, or rather squatting
on a chair, waiting for me, blinking his beady little
eyes and looking as solemn as an owl. I told him
all my schemes. I explained that I was a painter,
thoroughly in sympathy with the Japanese, and that
I wanted his help to gather together a company of
workers&mdash;fan-workers, metal-workers, and screen-workers&mdash;in
order to furnish a house that I had
built in London. He grasped my idea in an instant,
and very soon entered into the spirit of the plan,
taking an enthusiastic interest in all my schemes.
Whenever there was anything that needed measuring
exactly, this little man would run his finger and
thumb over it in the most dexterous manner possible,
murmuring to himself, &ldquo;One inchie, two inchie, three
inchie, seven-and-a-half inchie,&rdquo; etc. I talked on and
on, expounding and arranging, until it must have been
nearly three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Japanese people
are in the habit of going to bed very early, and soon
my little ally became obviously sleepy, although he
was far too polite to admit it. Only when midnight
struck did he beg that he might be allowed to
smoke a pipe, in order, as he said, &ldquo;to keep himself
awake.&rdquo; I gave him permission, and he immediately
jumped into the fireplace, crouching right down in
the fender, close up against the red-hot coals, and
smoked his miniature pipe there. I talked on, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
he listened, really interested in everything I said,
and gazing at me with his little beady eyes, bright
with interest, yet blinking so rapidly that there was
almost a mist over them. Then, for the first time,
I noticed that the little soul was tired, and, feeling
that it would be cruel to keep him up any longer, I
bade him good-night and shut the door.</p>

<p>For almost an hour after he had gone, I sat on
dreaming and brooding. Then I was suddenly aroused
by hearing a fumbling noise outside my room, as
though some one were tapping at the hall door. I
went out to see who the intruder might be, and
there I found my little Japanese friend, practically
asleep, but running his fingers all over the bolted
door, trying to measure it, and murmuring, &ldquo;one
inchie, two inchie, three inchie.&rdquo; From that moment
I christened him &ldquo;Inchie,&rdquo; and now all over Japan
at the present time this little man is known as Mr.
Inchie.</p>

<p>After that night Inchie became my constant companion
and friend. Wherever I went he came. Whether it
was to theatres, neighbouring towns, metal-workers or
fan-workers, Inchie always accompanied me, until in the
end it became a daily habit for him to drift about with
me in the sunshine, neglecting his business entirely.
For Inchie was an artist first and a merchant after.
We visited the temples, where Inchie taught me to
appreciate the difference between a degenerate Buddha
and a perfect Buddha, a difference so subtle as to be
quite indistinguishable to the alien. Gradually, bit by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
bit, as I grew to know him better, this little merchant&rsquo;s
true nature revealed itself to me. I began to see the
man apart from the merchant, and he proved himself to
be a great artist. Here in England we should call him
a distinguished genius, and undoubtedly there are scores
of equally brilliant men in Japan.</p>

<p>I have indeed no reason to believe that there are
any men in Japan who are not brilliant, considering
that here, the first man I had met, an ordinary little
merchant in a hotel for Europeans, was an artist. Every
day we wandered about the streets trying to discover
the best operators in metal, wood, and bronze to work
for me; and in a very short time we had gathered
together a bevy of excellent associates, each thoroughly
proficient in his own particular direction.</p>

<p>Inchie and I talked out our plans during our many
walks through Uyeno Park and down the theatre streets,
and we came to the conclusion that this Japanese house
of mine should be a house of flowers. Each room
should be some individual and beautiful flower&mdash;such
as the peony, the camelia, the cherry-blossom, the
chrysanthemum,&mdash;and, just as a flower begins simply at
the base, expanding as it reaches the top into a full-blown
bloom, so my rooms should begin with simple
one-coloured walls and carpets, becoming richer and
richer as they mounted up, ending as they reached the
ceiling in a perfect blaze of detail.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:498px; height:630px" src="images/img286.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SWINGING ALONG IN THE SUN</p></div>

<p>That was my dream; but, unlike most dreams, it
was realised to the full and far beyond my widest
expectations. I first of all turned my attention towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
the wood-carvers; and, discovering that each man had
his favourite flower, which he manipulated more skilfully
than any other, I arranged that he should work solely
on that particular species. Having found three or four
men who had a special fancy for the peony, I allowed
them to occupy themselves entirely in the peony room.
I gave them the exact measurement of the ceiling,
squaring it out into a certain number of panels, with
complete measurements of the doors, the frieze, and
every portion of the room, allowing them to give bent
to their own artistic instincts as to colour and design.
These drawings were then handed over to the wood-carvers,
to be pasted on to wood panels and carved.
In a very short time every workman in Inchie&rsquo;s store,
and every artist too, became enthusiastically interested
in this work that they were undertaking. In fact, it
was not work to them at all, but one long artistic joy.
So much rubbishy bric-a-brac has to be made for the
European market that when a Japanese is allowed to go
his own way and create self-imagined beautiful things,
it is an untold personal pleasure to him.</p>

<p>I never saw a body of men work together so unselfishly
as these. The metal-workers in the peony
room went on in sympathy with the wood-carvers
from the cherry-blossom hall; the screen-makers were
interested in the proceedings of the fan-makers; and
the designers were interested in them all. Each individual
operative was zealously interested in the success
of the results as a whole; and the end is that my house
now looks like the product of one man, or rather of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
master. It was a revelation to me, after my experience
of British workmen, to see the way these little Jap
fellows toiled. How they would talk and plan out
schemes of decoration for me among themselves, studying
peony flowers, for instance, in some celebrated
temple garden in order to introduce a new and more
natural feeling into their wooden ones; and then the
joy with which they would think out every little detail,
flying round to my hotel at all times of the day to
inform me of some new departure, surprised and pleased
me greatly.</p>

<p>These men were all brilliant craftsmen and designers,
creating work that could not be surpassed in Italy or
anywhere else for beauty. Yet the bulk of them were
poorly fed, receiving only sevenpence or eightpence a
day. Too poor to buy meat, they lived on rice and on
the heads and tails of fish twice a week, being unable to
afford that which was between.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:489px; height:630px" src="images/img290.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A METAL-WORKER</p></div>

<p>But although the Japanese workman is very poorly
paid, it must also be remembered that his necessities
are few and simple. This is roughly the way a workman
in Japan lives. He has one meal of rice per day,
of the poorest quality, which costs him two sen eight
rin. A sen is a tenth part of a penny, and a rin
a tenth part of a sen. For a mat to sleep on at
night he pays one sen five rin. Three sen he pays
for fish or the insides of fowls. Drinking-water costs
him two rin, while two rin per day pays for the
priest. The total cost of his daily living thus sums
up into about five sen three rin. Then, as to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
buried at the public expense is considered a deep
disgrace, forty sen is always put on one side for the
purchase of a coffin, seventy-five sen if the gentleman
wishes to be cremated, twenty sen for refreshments
for mourners, five rin for flowers, three sen for the
fees of the two priests, while, to economise, a Japanese
of the lower grade will generally make use of friends
as bearers.</p>

<p>Apropos of the absurdly small price at which a man
can live in Japan, I am reminded of an experience in
Kioto. I was walking down the theatre streets one
day with a Japanese friend, and we stopped in front
of a little stall full of very dainty toys. There were
thousands of toys&mdash;miniature kitchen utensils exquisitely
carved in wood, small pots and pans and dishes, all
bound with lacquer and beautifully finished, such as
would delight the heart of every housewife of my
acquaintance. I asked the stall-holder, a little stolid
old man, through the interpretation of my friend, how
much he would sell his entire stock for. His excitement
was intense, and my friend told me that my
simple question had had the effect of an avalanche
upon this stolid little toy-seller, and that he was quite
unable to grasp my meaning, so startling and gigantic
did the transaction seem to him. After a great deal
of gesticulation, and much flicking of the beads on
his counting machine, the little man came to the conclusion
that his entire stock would be worth two yen
thirty sen. This ridiculous price quite took my breath
away, and I immediately said that I would buy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
lot. Then there was another commotion: the little
man was thoroughly upset, and could not understand
what I meant. In the end I made him carry away his
stall bodily and follow me with it to my hotel. I
paid him the money, and he quickly disappeared.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see that little gentleman in theatre street
again in a hurry,&rdquo; my friend said: &ldquo;he will be living
in luxury now for a week or more on that two dollar
thirty sen, and he certainly won&rsquo;t dream of doing any
more work until he has spent the lot.&rdquo; Sure enough,
I never saw the stolid toy-seller again during the whole
of my stay in Kioto, which stretched over more than
a month. But although the coolie and the workman
in Japan live on next to nothing, the rich man spends
very lavishly. If he entertains you, he gives you a
dinner which, although you seldom appreciate its
splendid qualities (for it does not appeal to the Western
palate), is, from the Japanese standpoint, truly regal.
There will be four or five different kinds of fish,
some of which will be specimens of great value; and a
dinner given at a Japanese tea-house by a merchant
to a European friend would cost more than the most
expensive dinner it is possible to procure at the Carlton
or at the Savoy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:492px" src="images/img294.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BRONZE-WORKERS</p></div>

<p>My men flourished on the heads and tails of fish,
and did splendid service. Day by day the decorations
for my house grew, as one worker after another was
added to the little band. One man recommended
another, and gradually the number increased, until at
last there were as many as seventy working for me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
Inchie was my help, my interpreter, my foreman. At
first there were many difficulties in the way, for Inchie&rsquo;s
knowledge of English was limited, and my knowledge
of Japanese was none at all. It thus arose
that the only method of making him understand me
was pantomime. One day, while discussing a certain
measurement, we became so involved that I was determined
to demonstrate my meaning. So I borrowed
the carpenter&rsquo;s tools and constructed a little model
of the house, with its different rooms, showing how
the carved ceilings and friezes should be placed. Inchie
was astounded that I should have so great a knowledge
of his own particular work of carpentry, and respected
me the more accordingly.</p>

<p>My one great obstacle with the men was in persuading
them to make several things alike. They were
all artists and hated repeating themselves, and without
rhyme or reason I would suddenly find that they
had made a red lacquer door twice the size of its
fellow by way of variety. When I first employed
them I made the grave mistake with my workers of
ordering large quantities at a time of required materials.
I actually ordered a hundred electric-light fittings&mdash;fairy-like
lamps daintily wrought in bronze, of which
they had made me a model&mdash;but they refused me point-blank,
and the only way to get them at all was by
asking a dozen at a time, and by arranging that each
dozen should be varied in some slight respect. It was
the same with my picture frames. They were to be
a combination of wood and silk, and when I told the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
master bronze-worker to make me two hundred of
them for my next exhibition in London, his face
clouded over; he was thoroughly displeased. &ldquo;No
can make,&rdquo; he said decisively: &ldquo;there is berry much
difficulty. Much it cost to make; I must get big
shops to do that; I no likee.&rdquo; The little man was
quite discouraged, and I was only able to procure my
frames by degrees.</p>

<p>Now, in England it would be quite the reverse&mdash;the
larger the order, the more contented the merchant; but
in Japan everything is made by hand. The men take
an artistic interest in the work. They hate repeating
themselves; and in all the panels designed for my carved
ceilings there were not two alike, although the entire
design formed a complete whole. Why in the world
we do not use Oriental labour in Europe is a marvel
to me.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:486px; height:630px" src="images/img298.jpg" alt="" />

<p>Nothing that these Japanese workmen made for me
at the rate of sevenpence or eightpence a day can be
approached in London for love or money. I had some
gold screens made for me in Japan. They were very
beautiful, and were made of gold on silk varnished over
and lacquered, with apple-green and vermilion silk
borders made from the linings of old dancing dresses.
These screens were so brilliant that they were like gold
mirrors in which a lady might see her reflection just
as accurately as in any Parisian cheval glass. In the
passage to England one of the screens became slightly
damaged. I was greatly distressed, and took it to a
celebrated firm of house-decorators to have it repaired.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
They undertook the task very confidently; but directly
they attempted to match the gold they found that it
was impossible to approach to anything like the brilliancy
of its surface, although every conceivable method was
attempted. They tried putting on gold and then burnishing
and varnishing it over to imitate the surface of
the lacquer. The result was that, to the present day,
that screen stands in my hall with the same dull, sullied
patch in the middle of it, a silent testimony to the
inferiority of the British house-decorator as compared
with his Japanese contemporary.</p>

<p>Little Inchie and I, as I have said, soon became great
friends. He followed me about wherever I went, and
I often lingered in his store, watching him sell curios to
English people and British merchants from Kobe. It
was often a revelation to observe the subtlety of the
man and the masterly way in which he handled these
inquiring visitors. He seemed to divine their inner-most
thoughts, and to know at a glance exactly what
they wanted, and the prices that they would be likely
to pay. After a time I learnt the price of nearly every
curio in his store. There was never a fixed value for
anything: Inchie was always led by his customer.
Perhaps an American and his wife would come in, the
man saying nothing, the wife remarking on everything.
It was, they said, all &ldquo;beautiful.&rdquo; I noticed that little
Inchie was not at all enthusiastic, merely answering their
questions, but not attempting to sell. He would not
waste an ounce of energy on them, and after a time
they would sweep out of the place, the lady gushing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
the last moment and saying how beautiful and exquisite
everything was. Directly they had gone I would ask
Inchie why he had not worked harder to try and sell
them something. &ldquo;Gentleman and lady not got big
pocket,&rdquo; he would say. How in the world he knew
that they had but little money puzzled me. &ldquo;Lady
berry much talk&mdash;American lady always berry much
talk. She say &lsquo;This curio number one,&rsquo; but never buy.
English daimio lady come to my store no berry much
talk; English gentleman no big pocket. When she
leave my store I say, &lsquo;Me presentie you.&rsquo;&rdquo; What little
Inchie means by this is that he feels that this English
lady is refined and really admires his beautiful things,
but cannot afford to buy them. He appreciates her
delicacy, and, in his quaint pidgin English, begs to be
allowed the privilege of giving her this little inexpensive
trifle to take away.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CARPENTER</p></div>

<p>Very often, when I was spending a morning in
Inchie&rsquo;s little curio store, a Kobe merchant would drop
in to buy&mdash;a pompous fellow and burly, asking the price
of everything he saw. &ldquo;How much is this? and how
much is that?&rdquo; he would say, and &ldquo;What do you
suppose you&rsquo;d charge for that?&rdquo; Inchie would look
up at the merchant and blink with almost a scared
expression, so meek was it. The merchant, like the
great bully that he was, feeling satisfied that he was
cowing the little man, would pick up a piece of ivory
and say, &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; &ldquo;Four dollars,&rdquo; answers
Inchie. &ldquo;Very dear,&rdquo; replies the merchant sternly.
Then Inchie would pick up another piece of ivory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
putting away the former, and say with a scared expression,
as though the merchant had frightened him down,
&ldquo;I charge two dollars for this.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will give you
one and a half dollar,&rdquo; urges the merchant. And little
Inchie, puckering his brow and in a melancholy voice,
says, &ldquo;I takee,&rdquo; the merchant going off highly delighted,
convinced that he has been robbing all round.</p>

<p>Immediately after he had left the store, the change
in Inchie was extraordinary. He was no longer meek
and melancholy, but gleeful and triumphant, and longing
to tell me what had happened. &ldquo;The merchant from
Kobe he berry much cheat, that man,&rdquo; he said, with a
chuckle. &ldquo;I show him number one curio, I ask him
number one cheap price, and he say, &lsquo;Berry de-ar.&rsquo;
Then I show him no number one curio and ask him
more double price. He say, &lsquo;I no pay that; I give
half that.&rsquo; He take away curio at half that price, and
that very good for me. I make more money like that
than when I sell good curio.&rdquo; Then Inchie explained
how very easy it is to deceive the average traveller.
He does not stand a chance against the Japanese
merchant, and half the collections of curios ticketed
and placed in museums in England as fine and unique
specimens are in reality worthless imitations.</p>

<p>The really fine productions never leave the country
at all. Westerners visiting Japan expect to secure fine
works of art by paying a small sum for them; but it
cannot possibly be done. In that country they know
the value of productions, and will not easily part with
them. Inchie, becoming very serious and natural,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
would give me a little lecture on the absurdity of
Westerners coming to Japan expecting to buy really
fine old curios and pictures at a small price, when no
Japanese would part with them for any consideration.
&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will come from your country
who thinks he understands Japan because he has read
some books about it, and has seen some examples of
bad art in England. That man has no eyes&mdash;he can&rsquo;t
see the really beautiful things. He comes to buy the
old kakemono. He won&rsquo;t buy the new kakemono by
the good man that lives now. He no understand if
it good or bad; but it must be old. Well, we make
him the old one;&rdquo; and here Inchie gave me an exact
description of how they make the old kakemonos.
They first begin by making the paper look old, and
every producer has his several methods of bringing
about age. This is how Inchie does it. He has
eight various stains in eight separate baths, in which
he puts his paper, holding the two opposite corners
and dashing it from one bath to another in one quick,
dexterous sweep. Then the paper is left to dry, and
out of about one hundred sheets stained in this way,
in all probability only a dozen will be found sufficiently
perfect to deceive the buyer. That is the beginning
of the manufacture of an imitation old kakemono to
be sold to the European connoisseur for hundreds of
dollars, afterwards to find its resting-place in some
celebrated museum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:492px; height:630px" src="images/img306.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MAKING UP ACCOUNTS</p></div>

<p>What chance has a European against a genius like
this? and how can he detect deception in objects that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
have been the result of such minute care and consideration?
The Japanese can imitate postage stamps so
accurately that the only hope of discovering a fraud
lies in analysing the gum at the back of a stamp.
When we stain paper in coffee or beer to give it the
effect of age, we consider that we have gone far in
the art of imposition; but in this direction, as in
many others, we are mere babies compared with the
Japanese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then, Inchie,&rdquo; I said, in reply to his statement
that it was child&rsquo;s play to deceive the Westerner, &ldquo;you
too are sometimes deceived by us. I know of a gentleman
in England who brought over to Japan a large
collection of modern porcelain of English manufacture,
and by clever handling he imposed the whole lot
on an artist at Osaka in exchange for some rare old
Satsuma.&rdquo; Then I enlarged on the hardship of the
story. I explained how the Englishman had persuaded
the Osaka painter to give up all the rare old Satsuma
that he had collected during the course of a lifetime in
exchange for this valueless English porcelain, remarking
that it was wrong and almost cruel to take such a
mean advantage of the poor Osaka merchant. &ldquo;And
what do you say to that for a clever fraud, Inchie?&rdquo;
I asked. Inchie only held his sides and laughed. At
last he said, &ldquo;Oh, he berry number one clever man, that
at Osaka&rdquo;; for, it seemed, he knew all about the
Englishman and his porcelain, and also about the
Satsuma. The painter, indeed, was known all over
Japan by his clever imitations of old Satsuma, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
was also generally known that he had given this
English gentleman a collection of imitations that he
had painted himself in exchange for the English
porcelain, which was interesting to him to study.
The person to be pitied in Inchie&rsquo;s estimation was
the biter bit; and he was &ldquo;number one sorry for
that Englishman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whenever any one fresh arrived in Tokio&mdash;young,
old, pretty, or plain&mdash;I always sent him or her to
Inchie&rsquo;s store to buy curios. Such streams of people
besieged him, all so different and some so quaint, that,
although they were good for trade, Inchie was very
uncertain as to whether they were good for me, and
was anxious to have the matter cleared up. &ldquo;You have
many friends,&rdquo; he would say, eyeing me suspiciously.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:488px" src="images/img310.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FINISHING TOUCHES</p></div>

<p>At length the crisis was reached which broke down
the barriers of Inchie&rsquo;s reserve and thoroughly upset
him, in the shape of a fair bulbous woman, who was a
terror! I was sitting in the reading-room of the hotel
one day, believing that I was alone, when a twangy
voice broke in upon the silence. &ldquo;Just fancy, he shot
himself for love of me,&rdquo; mentioning a name in Yokohama.
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; I observed, feeling embarrassed (he
must have been mad, I thought). &ldquo;Yes; he blew his
brains out. Have a drink?&rdquo; she went on, in an
exuberance of generosity. I said, &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo; She
replied that if I would not she would, and she did.
She wanted to buy curios. I at once suggested Inchie,
which was a happy inspiration. Inchie came round,
and I left them in the reading-room together discussing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
cloisonné umbrella handles. My companion was lost
to me for three full days, being wholly occupied with
the fair visitant. He turned up at last, but in a state
of fever, his eyes sparkling and blinking indignantly.
He handed me a letter that he had just written to his
latest customer, my friend the bulbous fair, who had
left for Shanghai that day. &ldquo;You order me much
porcelain; you order me many curios; I no can send.
I think you better go porcelain Yokohama. Much
cheaper you get Yokohama, more number one,&rdquo;
Inchie&rsquo;s letter ran. &ldquo;Yes; but, Inchie,&rdquo; I remonstrated,
&ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you serve her? She&rsquo;s a good customer
for you.&rdquo; He was violent with rage. &ldquo;I no like the
lady,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she no daimio lady. Tea-house lady,
I think, with tea-coloured hair. She received me with
not a proper dress on; she smoke and drink. I no
want to serve lady like that. She no friend of yours?&rdquo;
he added, eagerly looking into my face with his piercing
little eyes. &ldquo;No, no, Inchie! of course not,&rdquo; I replied,
for I wasn&rsquo;t going to claim her. &ldquo;Ah, I thought
she no friend of yours,&rdquo; and Inchie smiled, while I
felt that I was respected once more and entered into
his good graces&mdash;it turned out for ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Inchie,&rdquo; I said to him one day, &ldquo;I want to
get a good porcelain man, the best in Tokio. Can you
manage it?&rdquo; There was nothing, so far as I knew, that
Inchie could not manage, so that in a very short time
he had found a little man, a pupil of the most eminent
porcelain maker in Tokio, also celebrated for his remarkable
glazes, who had just started a business of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
own. We drove round to his store to ask him if he
would undertake the painting of a dinner-service, and
do other things for me. He was a young man, this
particular painter, but with the face of a very old one,
careworn and haggard, quite an enthusiast, full of
interest in his art, and a craftsman of the highest order.
When he found that I too was in the same ranks, his
sympathies were aroused, and he devoted a whole
month solely to the firing and painting of my porcelain.
After a time I began to understand the man and his
processes. He brought out little bits of choice Chinese-blue
porcelain to show me. Whenever there was to
be a three-days&rsquo; firing he would come round to my
hotel and inform me of it. Altogether he developed
into quite a friend, almost to the dethronement of
Inchie. He allowed me to sit among the men while
they worked, and, seeing how interested I was, they
gave me some clay to model and paint. I ended by
painting a whole dinner-service in blue and white. It
took me a week to do; but it was perhaps one of the
most delightful experiences I have ever had, and I can
safely say that I have never worked in a more congenial
atmosphere than when sitting on a mat in that little
porcelain shop surrounded by those twelve little artists.
I shall never forget the anxious moments when my
products were being fired. Sometimes I have gone on
for twelve or fourteen hours, eating and resting with
the men, taking my turn at keeping the furnace alight,
and hanging about after the kilns had cooled to see my
valuable porcelain dug out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:491px; height:630px" src="images/img314.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A BACK CANAL, OSAKA</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
Nothing can be more exciting than the first peep at
porcelain after it has been fired. A mass of dead heavy-looking
clay is put into the furnace and fired; you
peep at it after some hours, and find, to your surprise,
a rare paradise of glazed white and blue, so brilliant
and sparkling that it seems almost impossible to have
been made by mortal hands. But then, of course, it is
not always so delightful; there are sometimes vexing
surprises awaiting you as you open the oven door.
Occasionally you will peep in and see a group of vases
looking like drunken men lolling against one another
in a disreputable manner, and lurching over at all
angles. Surrounded by a series of failures such as these,
the finest work is almost invariably found. Although
the vases have all been painted by the same hand and
fired in the same kiln, only one will be perfect, while
the rest are worthless. This is probably brought about
by some subtle influence to be found in the placing of
the vase in the kiln. There is, however, a great deal of
uncertainty in such operations, and it is almost impossible
to foretell the fate of any piece of ware after it
has been set in the firing kiln.</p>

<p>Inchie and I spent much of our time with the bronze-workers,
and it amused me to see these artists carrying
out designs for the European market, while to hear
their comments upon the crude productions of Englishmen
was sometimes very funny indeed.</p>

<p>The men who were thus engaged were at the same
time carrying out exquisite work for me. They complained
that the European market insisted upon everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
being over-elaborated and very showy, and at the
same time very old. This combination is quite impossible.
The old Japanese bronze work was always
very simple in design, depending for its beauty, not
upon the flowery decorations surrounding it, but upon
the exquisite proportions of the piece itself. To create
the aged appearance necessary in the eyes of the faddy
European, the bronzes have to be buried in the earth&mdash;in
a special kind of earth&mdash;for a few days; after
which they are dug up and sold to connoisseurs and
English people, who are by way of understanding works
of art, for fabulous sums.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:495px" src="images/img318.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STENCIL-MAKERS</p></div>

<p>I had occasion to employ many embroiderers; and
here, as in every other branch of Japanese art work, I
received a series of &ldquo;eye-openers.&rdquo; Hitherto I had
been envious of the many fine old bits of embroidery
and temple hangings shown me by the different globe-trotters
staying at the hotel. They had all come upon
their treasures in some lucky and unexpected manner.
By much good fortune every man had secured his own
special piece of embroidery, and each by clever manipulation
had outwitted the dealer from whom he had
managed to wrest this one old temple hanging. But
when I went to headquarters, and began to employ the
men who actually made the fabric, my envy vanished.
I soon found that none of these coveted treasures was
old at all. Such large pieces of embroidery are not
used in temples, nor have they ever been; they are
quite modern introductions, and have been brought
about simply to attract and make money out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
credulous strangers. I have spent hour after hour with
the embroiderers, watching them manipulate old temple
hangings, and have seen them when the task was over
wash on gold stains with base metal. Here and there
a few little touches would be of real gold, and it was
all done so cleverly that none but a Jap could possibly
detect that they were modern.</p>

<p>It is almost a depressing sight to watch these
embroiderers at work&mdash;so different are they from the
happy boisterous metal-workers talking and laughing
amid the clanging of their little hammers. They are
sad and silent. You will be in a roomful of these
people for perhaps a whole morning, and not one of
them will utter a word. They work on and on, with
heads bent down, picking up thread after thread of the
one piece of embroidery that they have been constantly
working on for months, or perhaps for years. Never
a word nor a smile; each peering into his own special
work with painful red eyes, on which are large bone-rimmed
spectacles. They all, as a rule, lose their sight
early in thus poring incessantly over this difficult and
dainty work.</p>

<p>I ordered several pieces of cotton crêpe of a certain
design that I had drawn myself, and it was during the
execution of this commission that I was brought into
touch with the stencil-workers and dyers of the country.
Stencil-cutting is one of the most beautiful arts imaginable.
To see the stencil-workers cutting fantastic
designs from the hard polished cardboard beneath their
instruments&mdash;so delicate that it is like the tracery of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
spider&rsquo;s web in its tenuity&mdash;is a sight that one never
forgets. Some of the designs are so cobweb-like that
single human hairs are used in parts to keep them from
breaking to pieces.</p>

<p>Dyeing is also an art that is brought to a high
degree of perfection in Japan. Sometimes an elaborate
design will need such a large number of plates and
colours, as well as finishing touches by the hand of
the operator, that in the end it looks almost like a
water-colour, so closely do the colours mingle one with
another.</p>

<p>Then there were the carpenters, and here a whole
series of surprises awaited me. For example, I found
that the teeth of their saws were set in what may be
called the opposite direction, and that therefore, when
a man pulled his instrument towards him, it cut the
wood, rather than when he pushed. In this, as in
everything else, the Japanese are perfectly right. One
always has more strength to pull than to push, and
with this method you are enabled to use saws made
of such thin metal that if their teeth were set in the
opposite direction they must needs cockle and break.
When a carpenter wants to plane some tiny piece of
wood, perhaps a portion of a miniature doll&rsquo;s house,
he does not run a small plane over it, as we do, but
uses a large heavy one, very sharp, and turned upside-down.
In this way very delicate work can be achieved.</p>

<p>All the Japanese tools are designed with a view
to their special fitness. The chisels work in a totally
different way from that of our chisels, and lend themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
more readily to delicate work. As to their little
wood-carving tools, they are perfect joys! I shall never
forget the expressions on the faces of my British workmen
as they unpacked the cases of goods that arrived
from Japan, and came across saws as thin as tissue
paper with their teeth set the wrong way; tiny chisels
that almost broke as they handled them; hammers the
size of a lady&rsquo;s hat-pin. My foreman&rsquo;s face was a
study of disgusted contempt. &ldquo;Now, how can a man
turn out decent work with tools like that?&rdquo; he
exclaimed, looking round appealingly. And it did
seem impossible. But not one of them complained
when they came across the actual work accomplished by
these ridiculously small instruments. The carpenters
were loud in their admiration for the wood-carving,
and the foreman merely sniffed. He knew that he
himself could not approach it. And this was soon
clearly proved, for if ever my hands tried to do a bit
of patching it was always a failure. All their joining
was as child&rsquo;s play when compared with this Japanese
triumph.</p>

<p>There was a man in Osaka, a perfect genius in wood-carving&mdash;the
king of carpenters. People journeyed
from long distances to pay their respects to him, and
he was the most independent person I ever saw in
my life. He never dreamt of undertaking service
for people unless they appreciated it and understood
its value. Very rich Americans have tried to persuade
him to engage for them; but, as he always demanded
that would-be purchasers should be capable of appreciating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
his work as that of an accomplished artist, they
rarely ever succeeded. Nearly all this man&rsquo;s work is
done for his own people at a very low price, and
Japanese wood-carvers are continually taking pilgrimages
to see him and to buy specimens of his productions.
He always demands to know what is going to become
of them, and where they are going to be placed, before
consenting to part with them. I had the wit not to
ask him to sell anything to me, nor to execute anything
for me, but simply admired his work as that of a unique
artist.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:497px; height:630px" src="images/img324.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A SIGN-PAINTER&rsquo;S</p></div>

<p>Most prominent among the toilers of Japan are
the workers in lacquer, clean and dainty beyond description,
with whom a great portion of my time was
taken up. The climate of the country is exactly suited
to the making of lacquer, being sufficiently damp. The
process is unusually elaborate, and is a tedious matter
of painting on a very large number of coats of lacquer,
rubbing them down always, and allowing them to dry.
When we think of lacquer here in England, we think of
it in connection with our tea-trays and like cheap goods
which we complain of as being made of bad material
that chips and breaks and becomes useless in a distressingly
short space of time. &ldquo;The Japanese have
lost the art of creating the fine old lacquer that they
used formerly,&rdquo; we say. But it is not so at all; it
is purely a question of time. If the Japanese were
allowed sufficient leisure, and were not rushed on so by
the requirements of the European market, they would
be able to turn out just as fine and just as durable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
lacquer as they did in the days when they worked for
the love of their work alone for purchase by their
fellow-countrymen. Practical proof of this can be
found in the fact that all the doors in my London
house, which are composed of the best lacquer, twenty
or thirty coats thick, and have been in constant use for
years, are still in perfect condition, and will be two
hundred years hence. One has no idea before going
to Japan of the extensive range of colours in the way
of greens, blues, and reds that there is in lacquer, for
most of the colours are entirely unknown in the West.
There is undoubtedly no surface in the world that is
as clear and as brilliant as lacquer, and I have often
thought how advantageous it would be if one could
only lacquer pictures over instead of varnishing them;
it would give to the poorest work a brilliancy and
crispness that would be simply invaluable. But this
brilliant surface is only brought about by excessive care
and cleanliness in its preparation&mdash;indeed, it needs
almost as much attention as the making of a collotype
plate.</p>

<p>I was anxious to get some really good cloisonné
workers to make some things for me, and by very
good luck I hit upon a man who had just discovered
an entirely new method of handling gold. Coming
across one of his samples at an exhibition in Tokio, I
ferreted him out and persuaded him to engage for me.
His cloisonné, unlike the ordinary slate-grey work that
one must needs peer closely into before discovering its
fine qualities, was bold in design, with flower patterns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
of cherry-blossom just traceable through a fine lacework
of gold, and it looked like a brilliant rainbow-hued
bubble. One is much inclined to fancy that
cloisonné vases with elaborate designs must necessarily
be expensive. That, however, is not the case. There
are technical obstacles connected with making broad
sweeps of colour in cloisonné that render simple designs
much more expensive. Japan is the only place
in the world that is capable of producing cloisonné,
for the patience and skill required would overtax the
workers of any other country, and such an attempt
would necessarily end in failure. A cloisonné shop is
every bit as depressing as the embroidery works. You
will see men picking up on the end of their tiny instruments
gold wire, which is so microscopic as to be like
a grain of dust, and almost as invisible. This tiny
morsel has to be placed on the metal vase and fixed there.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:491px" src="images/img328.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A CLOISONNÉ WORKER</p></div>

<p>Talking of the delicate and exquisite tools used
by cloisonné workers reminds me of tools that are
just as delicate, but used for quite another purpose&mdash;namely,
those which the Japanese dentists handle
so dexterously. However, the stock-in-trade of a
Japanese dentist chiefly consists of the proper use of
his finger and thumb. The most strongly-rooted tooth
invariably gives way to this instrument. A Japanese
dentist has only to apply his fingers to a tooth, and out
that tooth comes on the instant. It is sometimes very
amusing to see a group of dentists&rsquo; assistants, all mere
children, practising their trade by endeavouring to pull
nails out of a board, beginning with tin tacks and ending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
with nails which are more firmly rooted than the real
teeth themselves.</p>

<p>When I had gathered my team together by the help
of my right-hand ally, Inchie, after having chosen the
best of them from every branch of art, they continued
to go on well and assiduously, and the decorations of
my house were in full swing, when suddenly there was
a break, a distinct break. I went round to the store
early one lovely morning in May, as was my habit, and
found, to my surprise, that the whole place was empty.
Not a metal-worker or carpenter was to be seen. They
had all mysteriously disappeared&mdash;where? To view
the cherry-blossom! Inchie also, whom I had relied
upon as a good steady colleague, had, on the first opportunity,
and without any warning, drifted away into the
open air with the whole band to view the blossom. The
Japanese workmen, who are skilled, and want examples
from Nature, evidently adhere to the principle that &ldquo;all
work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,&rdquo; and so, whether
I liked it or not, when such a glorious day had presented
itself, they were not going to miss the opportunity of
enjoying it. It was a holiday, or rather the sunshine had
declared it to be a holiday, and all Japan, rich and poor,
employers and employed, had turned out to picnic in
the parks, and feast their eyes upon the cherry-blossom.
So universal was the holiday, and so persistently did
Inchie implore that I should join them, that I soon
found myself sitting under the trees in Uyeno Park,
surrounded by my deserters, enjoying things as well
as any one of them there.</p>

<p class="caption">A TOY-SHOP</p></div>

<p>It was on this day, out of the pure joy of the idea,
that Inchie proposed to give me a real Japanese dinner,
and at the same time show me some of the fine old
classical dances of Japan. I remember that night so
well! Inchie invited three other Japanese friends, and
we all went down into the basement with rod and line,
or, to be exact, with a net, to catch our own fish for
dinner. It was to me novel sport chasing those lazy
old goldfish round the tank. I secured a monster,
which beat Inchie&rsquo;s out and out for size. Inchie was in
splendid form on this occasion; it was a field-night for
him, and he was quite at his best. He was an enormous
eater; he ate anything you chose to give him, and he
enjoyed the dinner that followed our half-hour spent
below stairs, I must confess, far more than I did. For
although the repast was of the very best quality, it was
after all Japanese, which statement speaks for itself,
as every one knows that Japanese food does not by
any means commend itself to the British palate. There
was our just-caught fish cooked with bamboo, meat of
different sorts, and many varieties in the soup character,
some of which were not bad. As for the Sake, it tasted
like bad sherry; but it had a most exhilarating effect
on Inchie, and in a very short time produced in him a
most natural and joyous frame of mind which enabled
me to see a side of his disposition that under ordinary
conditions would never have come to the surface. One
of the courses of this dinner of dinners was a chicken,
provided out of deference to my European tastes, and
Inchie carved it. It was a muscular bird; but Inchie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
carved it with a pair of large chopsticks as I have
never seen a chicken carved before in any part of the
globe. Not even Joseph of the Savoy with his flourish
of fork and knife in mid-air could compete with Inchie
and his pair of wooden chopsticks. No knives nor
fingers were used; but the whole was limbed, cut up,
and served in less than the period that Joseph would
take in his skilled dexterity.</p>

<p>I remarked upon his skill in handling the chopsticks,
and Inchie at once suggested that we should all have a
competition to see who could pick up the greatest
amount of peas with chopsticks in the shortest possible
time. Each was given a lacquer tray with carefully
numbered green peas, cold and cooked&mdash;the number
according to the proficiency of the player. Inchie&rsquo;s
plate was loaded; the guests and geishas had a fair
amount; but I had only three, and the aim was to pick
them up one by one and put them into our mouths,
the competitor whose plate was empty first being
declared the winner. We started, and I was so intent on
the manipulation of my three green peas that I was only
conscious of a whirl of hands, never having noticed that
the rest had finished their pile before I had picked up
my second pea. I never undertook such a task before,
nor ever will again. The discouragement of it was final.
My first pea, after no little exertion and much sleight of
hand, I had raised to my lips on the points of the chopsticks,
when just at the critical moment it abruptly left its
moorings, went like a shot from a catapult across the
room, and settled itself on the lap of one of the geishas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
who was thereby promptly put out of the contest. I
do not know what happened to the second pea, much less
of the fate of the third; all I remember is that I came
in a very bad last in the chopstick competition.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:499px; height:630px" src="images/img336.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A SWEET-STUFF STALL</p></div>

<p>What with the Sake, the competition, and the dinner,
Inchie became more and more brilliant, until at last an
idea sparkled out that was worthy of his distinction. I
was to have a piece of wood-carving in my London
house that should be as it were the eye of the peacock&mdash;the
first ever made in Japan! We should go to
Osaka together, he remarked, the very next day, choose
a great piece of wood 8 or 9 feet in length, 3 feet broad,
and about 6 inches through, and have it carved in the
most beautiful and magnificent chrysanthemum pattern
ever seen&mdash;for the hall was of chrysanthemums. His
eyes sparkled as he said, &ldquo;You are going to have berry
number one house; must have one big number one
piece chrysanthemum carving&mdash;better than any other
carving, better than temple carving.&rdquo; The Sake passed
round, the geishas danced, and Inchie talked, while
with every cup he grew brighter and brighter, and his
eyes sparkled like jewels. I was beginning to see the
real Inchie. Was this really the little man, the laughing-stock
of the hotel, bullied and sworn at by every one?
He talked of Hookosai, who, he asserted, was not the
great master that he is universally considered to be in
Europe. Hookosai was too realistic; many other
artists were far finer. Yet another cup of Sake was
passed round and drained. &ldquo;I will demonstrate some
Hookosai pictures,&rdquo; said little Inchie, in a tone of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
suppressed excitement; and, stepping behind a screen
as he spoke, reappeared almost immediately with a
handkerchief rolled round his head and his kimono
tucked up, posing in the attitude of one of the most
celebrated of Hookosai&rsquo;s pictures. Twenty or thirty
pictures were represented, and in each he was a different
man merely by changing the muscles of his face. Never
have I seen such acting in my life; he was like a gallery
of Hookosai&rsquo;s pictures rolled into one, with all their
queer exaggeration.</p>

<p>More Sake was drunk, and later in the evening
Inchie became so excited that, in order to work off
his condition, he made the remarkable proposal that
he should show me a devil dance. When he emerged
from behind the screen, the geishas were frightened
and drew back in alarm; for he was no longer the
gentle little monkey merchant, but a real devil. As
for the dancing, I never saw anything so superbly
fine! It almost took my breath away. He seemed
almost superhuman, an ethereal creature.</p>

<p>The evening ended up in the usual way. Next
morning Inchie came round to my hotel, sat down
on a chair looking amazingly sheepish, and blinked
solemnly at me. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s up now, Inchie?&rdquo; I
inquired, seeing that he had something to say. &ldquo;Berry
number one bad night last night, Sir,&rdquo; moaned Inchie
with a shake of his head. &ldquo;I no want you to tell
people I do the devil dance last night. They no
understand and berry much talk. Please, I beg you
not tell!&rdquo; And poor little Inchie went about for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
days with a drooping head, looking the picture of
misery. But in my opinion, he had no reason to
be ashamed of his conduct; he had shown himself
to be a versatile genius. He had acted as I never
before have seen a man act; he had also danced as
I have never seen a man dance; and he had drunk
as I have never seen a man drink without becoming
badly affected. Nevertheless, this was the man who
had allowed himself, and was allowing himself, to be
sworn at, bullied, and even kicked by the common sorts
and by the vulgar globe-trotters.</p>

<p>The day following the night of the never-to-be-forgotten
dinner, Inchie and I went, as we had
intended, to Osaka to choose a fine and sufficiently
well-seasoned piece of wood for this famous and all-important
wood-carving, the eye of the peacock. I
think we must have visited every timber-yard in Osaka
in search of a fitting plank, and it was too funny to
see the way Inchie would crawl over a piece of wood,
like the small monkey that he was, scratching, rubbing,
picking it with his nail, and even putting his tongue
upon it to test its quality. At last a plank was found
that was declared to be &ldquo;berry number one,&rdquo; and the
great undertaking, the work of carving it, began. Five
men were at work on it for five months. And now
that it is completed and fixed in my chrysanthemum
hall, it is a triumph! It is a joy&mdash;it is a possession!
At the same time, when we were in Osaka, Inchie
was struck with another brilliant idea. I must have
a gong, he said, a superb gong; and as Inchie himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
had once been a metal-worker, he was an excellent
judge of gongs and undertook to choose one for
me. Before that day I had no notion that there
could be such a vast difference in gongs. We went
to about twenty or thirty stores in Osaka, at each of
which several gongs were produced for our inspection.
And Inchie bounded about the shop like a cat or a
leopard, from one corner of the room to the other,
crouching down on the ground with his hand over
his ear, striking each in turn, and listening to its
vibration. &ldquo;No berry good that,&rdquo; he would whisper
to me, and then, talking charmingly to the merchant,&mdash;for
Inchie was always charming&mdash;he would bow
himself gracefully out of the shop. At each store
in turn the same thing happened, until at last we
reached a shop which seemed to me still more
improbable than the rest, for it was a dirty little
hole of a place, with no such thing as a gong in
sight. In reply to our usual question the proprietor
dived into a tangled bit of garden at the back, and
presently reappeared with an old rusty gong, very
thin with age and use and exposure to all weathers,
and looking not worth twopence. Inchie struck it,
and the expression on his face was extraordinary as
he looked round at me. The tone was superb. This
was the gong of gongs! &ldquo;That berry number one,&rdquo;
he exclaimed in a stage whisper. We secured the
gong for a few cents. &ldquo;Big-pockety man no berry
clever, I think,&rdquo; remarked Inchie pensively.</p>

<p>It was on the day of my last visit to his store before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
sailing for England, and Inchie was very sad, very earnest,
and very anxious to give me the best possible advice
as to what to do in the way of selling when I arrived
at my &ldquo;store,&rdquo; as he termed it, in England. &ldquo;When
big-pocket man come to Japan, every merchant know,
and all wait for him,&rdquo; said Inchie, by way of demonstrating
to me how very easy it was to entrap a rich man into
buying one&rsquo;s goods. Inchie also told me the following
story of how two big-pockety men once fared at
the hands of a very subtle merchant. He was a Tokio
merchant, and directly he heard of their probable arrival
he sent experienced guides to almost every port in Japan
to waylay these arrivals. They were eventually caught
at Kobe, and were led all over Japan by a remarkably
efficient guide, in due course reaching Tokio. After
visiting many curio stores they were safely landed at
the store of the master exactor. Then the trickery
developed. The merchant began to flatter and compliment
the richer of the two, and knowing that they were
anxious to buy gold lacquer he said: &ldquo;You are a
great connoisseur on gold lacquer, I believe. They tell
me that you have a quick eye for fine work, and I have
heard much of your appreciation of Japanese art.&rdquo; The
big-pockety man was thus won over into a limp and
restful condition, for no one can flatter to such good
advantage as the Japanese.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:489px; height:630px" src="images/img342.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A CANAL IN OSAKA</p></div>

<p>Meantime the guide was walking about the shop with
his mouth wide open and looking silly. He was there
to protect the two men, and the keenest observer could
never have guessed that he was in reality the agent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
this merchant. &ldquo;I want your guide to take you round
to all the gold lacquer shops you can, for I know that
that is what you appreciate and love so much. After
you have seen all that the merchants can show you,
come back to me and see what you think of my
specimens.&rdquo; All this time he was toying with a little
insignificant-looking gold lacquer tray, turning it about
under the rich man&rsquo;s very nose in such a way that he
was bound to notice it. &ldquo;We Japanese are so clever,
you know, and we are such good imitators of lacquer
that even I, a Japanese, am liable at times to be misled
by some of the deceptions. But,&rdquo; continued the
merchant in an off-hand manner, &ldquo;there is one sure test
of real gold lacquer, and that is the fire test.&rdquo; So saying
he carelessly lit a match and allowed it to play all over
the gold lacquer tray; then quietly and without any
demonstration he handed it to the rich man and begged
him to observe that it was not harmed in any way,
taking it for granted that he, the rich man, naturally
knew of the fire test.</p>

<p>The big-pocket man puckered his fat brow critically&mdash;he
really knew nothing about it&mdash;and rubbed his greasy
palm over the surface of the lacquer. The difference
between the hands of the two men was a characteristic
study&mdash;one big and flabby, the other slim and sinuous
with fingers that almost turned back in their energy.
After examining the tray closely the visitor admitted
that it was in truth untouched. The master exactor
smiled, and, like the rogue he was, never referred to it
again. The two rich men went away with their guide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
and visited half a dozen other stores in Tokio, trying
the fire test on all the gold lacquer they could find, with
disastrous consequences.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:492px" src="images/img346.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">UMBRELLAS AND COMMERCE</p></div>

<p>They had to pay for damages wherever they went,
and wherever they went the merchants were indignant,
for real gold lacquer, as every one knows, will not stand
such treatment unless it happens to be a flat tray. But
the rich men only chuckled at their superior knowledge
and paid the damages without a murmur. Then they
went back to the store of the evil prompter and did
exactly as he expected they would do; they bought
ten thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of gold lacquer, all of which
was &ldquo;berry number one imitation gold lacquer,&rdquo; as
Inchie remarked. &ldquo;Well, but, Inchie, I couldn&rsquo;t treat
people like that.&rdquo; I told the little man &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
know how.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I will show you how to sell,&rdquo;
quoth Inchie: &ldquo;I show you how to sell two-cent blue
porcelain pot in your store for two hundred dollars to
big-pockety man&rdquo;; whereupon Inchie proceeded to give
me a lesson in the art of selling. He first brought
out a nest of six lacquer boxes that fitted one into
the other; then he held up the two-cent porcelain pot,&mdash;and
the way he handled it made it already begin to
appear valuable in my eyes. I truly believe that Inchie
could stroke out a piece of newspaper and make it seem
as rare as a bank-note. Then this little genius wrapped
the worthless blue porcelain in yellow silk, and placed
it in the smallest lacquer box, which with its lid he
secured inside a larger box, and so on until the entire
six boxes and their lids encased his gem. Placing it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
upon the table, he began to explain how I should sell
it, and in order to describe the subtlety of the transaction
I must give it in Inchie&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;Big-pockety
man come your store in England and he say, &lsquo;Mr.
Menpes, you bought number one curio in Japan?&rsquo;
You say, &lsquo;No buy curio in Japan,&rsquo; but you talk much
to him of all the beautiful things you see in Japan.
After a time you look on the ground and think&mdash;much
you show you think. Big-pockety man look at you
and he no talk. You look up quick and you say, &lsquo;Oh,
number one curio I buy Japan, I remember!&rsquo; He
say, &lsquo;Please show me curio.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never I show curio,&rsquo;
you tell him. &lsquo;I buy number one curio, but I no want
to show.&rsquo; Then you talk to him about Japan, all the
streets and the theatres you see in Japan; but all the
time he talk of curio&mdash;&lsquo;I ber-ry much want to see,&rsquo; he
say. You say, &lsquo;You friend, you number one friend?
Very well, I show.&rsquo;&rdquo; After having thus given way you
must go upstairs and look for the curio, and&mdash;Inchie
laid a stress upon this last statement&mdash;&ldquo;you must be a
long time finding it. When you come back you place
the large lacquer box containing the five smaller boxes
and the Buddha&rsquo;s eye&mdash;the Holy of Holies&mdash;upon the
table, and much you begin to talk about Japan, berry
like American lady talk I think; you no talk to him
then about porcelain. After much talk about beautiful
blossom you take out one box; then you talk more
and take out another box&mdash;gentleman he ber-ry much
want to see. When you come to final piecee box he
berry much excited, and when you take out the porcelain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
and yellow silk you berry berry quiet&mdash;no artistic to
talk now. Then you drop the corners of the silk and
look at the porcelain. You no talk, big-pockety man
no talk; he no understand this&mdash;berry funny. Somebody
must talk, all quiet; you rest long time no talk,
and big-pockety man say, &lsquo;Berry much number one
curio that I think&mdash;how much you sell?&rsquo; You say,
&lsquo;I no sell. Berry much money that costee me Japan,
much ricksha, much hotel. Number one Chinese
porcelain that. Number one glaze. I no sell,&rsquo;&rdquo; And to
cut the story short I must explain that &ldquo;the big-pockety
man&rdquo;&mdash;that is the millionaire&mdash;is by this time in a
perfect fever to possess my priceless blue porcelain, and,
Inchie says, here I must weaken, and after asking him if
he is &ldquo;daimio gentleman number one,&rdquo; I must allow
him to buy my two-cent vase for two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>In giving me this important lesson in the art of
selling, Inchie considered that he had shown me the
truest mark of friendship, and that he had given me
the most valuable present in his power, and far more
useful than any jewel could be.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the work, when the house was
nearly completed, and I had entertained mentally almost
every friend I knew, and had missed nothing from the
door-mat to the red lacquer soup-bowls on the dining-room
table, I suddenly remembered the door-knocker.
There was no door-knocker! I immediately interviewed
Inchie and asked him to help me to design a door-knocker.
Seeing that the only doors they have in Japan
are sliding ones made of tissue paper, it was some time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
before Inchie could comprehend my meaning. &ldquo;I no
understand why you want to knock at the door. Very
funny that!&rdquo; he said. I explained that in England it
was necessary to have very strong doors which one could
not leave open lest people should come in and steal.
He blinked his little eyes and looked up at me
intelligently: &ldquo;I understand!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;berry
number one bad Chinaman come and steal.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;not Chinaman, but Englishman.&rdquo; &ldquo;I no understand,&rdquo;
he repeated. After much pantomime and talk I
at last conveyed to him a fairly good idea of what was
needed in the way of a door-knocker, and sent him home
to work out some suitable design. Three days after he
came back carrying under his arm a huge roll of drawings,
which he proceeded to unfold on the floor. A
glance was enough to show me that the little fellow had
not got hold of the kind of door-knocker I required,
and I watched him with a limp and hopeless feeling. &ldquo;Go
on, Inchie: explain it,&rdquo; I said. He was in very good
condition this morning&mdash;pleased with himself and the
world in general, and more especially with his door-knocker
design. Drawing in his breath with a little
satisfied hiss, he began: &ldquo;Now, you see, you first put on
the door a large chrysanthemum in bronze,&rdquo; and Inchie
went through the performance in pantomime. &ldquo;In the
centre of this chrysanthemum a rod of steel must be fixed
five inches in length. Suspended from the rod of steel
must be a silk cord about five inches in length, and
attached to the cord a marble about the size of a child&rsquo;s
playing marble. Underneath the large chrysanthemum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
and in line with the marble, should be placed another
chrysanthemum with a miniature gong in the centre
three-quarters of an inch in diameter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait a bit,
Inchie,&rdquo; I cried, for this description was too much for
me&mdash;I must digest it more slowly. I pictured to myself
the strings of children that pass and repass my house in
Cadogan Gardens on their way to and from school, and
their feelings concerning this small metal ball waving in
the soft wind of a summer&rsquo;s afternoon on its apple-green
cord. It would be too gorgeous an attraction by
far! No child could have the heart to destroy so rare
a thing at once, it would be far too great a joy; they
would save it at least until their return journey from
school before even touching it. Seeing that the small
man was becoming a little offended, I said, &ldquo;Fire away,
Inchie,&mdash;what next?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, when you come home
after dinner, you take the marble and hold it five inches
from the gong. You shut one eye and take aim; then
you let go, and he goes ping! ping! and gentleman he
come and open the door.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t, Inchie,&rdquo;
I shouted: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wrong there&mdash;the gentleman doesn&rsquo;t
open the door.&rdquo; &ldquo;I no understand,&rdquo; said little Inchie,
his face falling,&mdash;&ldquo;why he no open the door?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
I explained, &ldquo;when you come home late at night
after dinner you must have very sure habits of taking
aim in order to strike that miniature gong three-quarters
of an inch in diameter.&rdquo; Inchie looked up at me with
bright pathetic little eyes, and said, &ldquo;Berry fine daimio
door-knocker this, and it is not difficult for you to strike.
I no understand!&rdquo; Then I took him on one side, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
wanting to hurt his feelings, and explained to him how
almost impossible it would be for a man coming home
after dinner, having walked hurriedly and all that, to
take aim at his miniature gong. &ldquo;You told me you could
shoot a rifle,&rdquo; was Inchie&rsquo;s reply. After that there was no
more to be said, for I realised that one must necessarily
be a rifle shot before you could get home at nights.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:487px; height:630px" src="images/img352.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLAYFELLOWS</p></div>

<p>The last I ever saw of poor little Inchie was when
he came on board the P. and O. steamer at Yokohama
to see me off on my journey to England. The
authorities would not allow him to lunch with me in
the saloon, and the poor little fellow, who was far more
refined and certainly had far more intelligence than any
one on board, captain and officers included, was compelled
to eat his luncheon standing up in the steward&rsquo;s pantry,
which hurt his feelings terribly. The only figure that
I seemed to see in the mist that enwrapped Yokohama
wharf was poor little Inchie standing there in his blue
kimono and quaint bowler hat, watching me with eager
blinking eyes that had a suspicion of moisture about
them, and lips that twitched slightly; and the last thing
I heard was, &ldquo;I think when you go to England you send
me berry many letters&mdash;often you send me.&rdquo; And I
felt as the steamer moved away that I had lost a good
and a true friend.</p>

<p>When the decorations for my house arrived in
London, the next and all important question to be considered
was how to put them up. Everything was
finished and ready to fix in its place without nails, and
the only thing left to be completed by the British workmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
was the slight wooden beams and square framework
in which the carved panels were to be fixed. I secured
five or six good workmen, and literally taught them how
to handle this material, but it took them two years to put
up what my Japanese craftsmen had produced in one year.
It was all straightforward clean design, and there was no
artistic effort needed for it; but the obstacle was that they
always struggled to make the woodwork a little thicker
than necessary. Their inclinations were always to
strengthen things, and it took a great deal of perseverance
and patience to uproot their fixed ideas. Then I
had a great deal of trouble with the painters. At first
they almost refused to put distemper on my walls.
Strings upon strings of painters I was compelled to
dismiss because they would persist in putting what they
called &ldquo;body&rdquo; into the paint. Sometimes they would
slip it in behind my back; but I always detected it and
dismissed the men on the instant. It was the only way.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been in the trade for thirty years and I&rsquo;ve
always used body&rdquo;&mdash;they all said that, and every
workman I have ever employed, or is yet to be employed,
always says the same. No matter how young or how
old they may be, they have always been in the trade for
thirty years. One painter I educated sufficiently to
allow of him going so far against his principles as to
leave out &ldquo;body,&rdquo; but when I ordered him to mix oil
and water by beating them together in a tub he declined
and left. The only men whom I was able to persuade
to do this for me were my foreman and one of the
carpenters. The foreman was a very intelligent little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
man, whom I had educated to such an extent that his
views of life and of workmen in general were entirely
changed. He sneered at them, and was altogether so
won over to my ideas that I am afraid I totally destroyed
him for any other work. The painter, on the other
hand, had no intelligence at all, but was equally devoted,
and I feel quite sure that those two poor operatives are
drifting about now doing anything but their respective
trades of carpentry and painting. They undertook the
beating of the oil and water very energetically, and kept
it up for days, relieved occasionally by the caretaker.
Eventually the oil did mix, and the experiment was a
great success. Towards the end of their training these
men became so accustomed to looking at things, if not
feeling them, from the decorative standpoint, that it was
no unusual occurrence to overhear such remarks as the
following. The foreman would say to his pal as he
caught sight of the reflection of his grimy face in a
mirror: &ldquo;I say, Bill, my flesh tone looks well against
this lemon yellow, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I suppose I must start
and wash off this toney&rdquo;&mdash;toney meaning dirt, but to
call it dirt would be to their enlightened minds vulgar
in the extreme. Everything with them was &ldquo;tone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days before they left for good I overheard a
conversation between Bill and his mate, who had begun
to feel the hopelessness of attempting work of a different
nature. &ldquo;What shall we do, Bill, when this blooming
job&rsquo;s over?&rdquo; said the foreman. &ldquo;I suppose we shall go
a-&rsquo;opping!&rdquo; replied Bill. It was then just about the
hopping season.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>CHARACTERISTICS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Perhaps</span> one of the most admirable features in the
character of the Japanese is their great power of
self-control. The superficial observer on his first
visit to Japan, because of this very quality of theirs,
is at first liable to imagine that the Japanese have
no emotion. This is a mistake. I have lived with
them; I know them through and through; and
I know that they are a people of great emotions,
emotions that are perhaps all the deeper and stronger
because they are unexpressed. Self-control is almost
a religion with the Japanese. In their opinion it is
wrong and selfish to the last degree to inflict one&rsquo;s
sorrows and one&rsquo;s cares upon other people. The world
is sad enough, they argue, without being made sadder
by the petty emotions of one&rsquo;s neighbour: so the people
of Japan all contrive to present a gay and happy
appearance to the outside world. You may express your
feelings in the solitude of your own room, and there is
no doubt that the Japanese suffer terribly among themselves,
although a stranger, and especially a European,
will never detect a trace of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
I once went to call, with a resident of Japan, on an
old Japanese lady, to condole with her on the loss of
her husband and her only son, who had both been swept
away, with thousands of others, in a great tidal wave
only a few days previously. As we neared the house
we saw, through the partially-opened sliding door, the
old woman rocking herself to and fro in an agony of
sorrow, literally contending with emotion, and suffering
as I have never seen a human being suffer before. I
was terribly shocked, and we naturally hesitated for
some time before announcing ourselves; but by the
time the mourner appeared at the door to greet us, she
was all smiles. It was difficult to believe that she
was the same woman. Her face shone with radiant
happiness, and all traces of sorrow had disappeared.
In the course of the conversation she did not avoid
the sore subject, but rather chose it, and talked
of the death of her husband and her son with a smiling
face and an expression by which one might very
pardonably have judged that she had no feelings whatever.
This was self-control indeed, and it is only in
Japan that one encounters such striking illustrations of
superb pluck and endurance.</p>

<p class="caption">YOUTH AND AGE</p></div>

<p>In my opinion, this great self-control is an evidence
of the very high standard of civilisation of the Japanese.
If one is at all observant and really in sympathy with
the people, one is continually catching glimpses of their
real natures and instances of their magnificent self-command.
Once I was talking to a little Japanese
merchant, along with some friends whom I had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
round to his store to buy curios. I had made quite a
friend of this man, and knew him well. We were all
chaffing him about getting married, and one of my
friends said to him, &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you get married?
But perhaps you have already got a wife!&rdquo; The little
man looked up quickly with a smile on his face, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Me married already; me wife die two years
past; two children die two years past; all die, I think.&rdquo;
The voice was perfectly steady, and the face smiling, as
he uttered this amazingly sad statement; but some one
chanced to look up and saw two great tears standing in
his little monkey-like eyes. Of course he was &ldquo;no
class,&rdquo; and, not being an actual workman, but only a
merchant, he was considered to be of rather a low grade.
Still, for this slight show of emotion, he had utterly
disgraced himself in his own eyes, and would afterwards,
no doubt, atone for it by torturing himself in private.</p>

<p>I saw many remarkable instances of the self-control of
the Japanese people when I visited the scenes of desolation
caused from that great tidal wave which destroyed
nearly three thousand people. Village after village I
visited, some of them with only three or four living
inhabitants left; but in no case, with men, women, or
children, did I see the slightest trace of emotion. Here
and there, indeed, you passed a woman huddled up in
a corner muttering and screaming, but only because her
mind had become unhinged by the loss of her home, or
probably village, and every relation she possessed. No
Japanese in his senses would amid the same circumstances
be guilty of so much as a murmur or a tear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
The Japanese are a brave people&mdash;not only the men,
but the women too. In fact, the women more especially
are brave. Many women destroyed themselves
during the China-Japanese war, because their husbands
had been killed in battle. There was one Japanese
woman in Tokio who felt so deeply the disgrace
placed upon her country by the attempt on the life
of the present Emperor of Russia some years ago
by a common coolie, that she committed suicide.
She felt that this great European prince had visited
her country as a guest, and that before Japan could
raise its head once more the nation must make some
great sacrifice. Day after day she visited the Legation,
and begged to be allowed admission to some of the
high officials&mdash;in vain: they were too busy to see
her. At last, after some weeks of fruitless effort,
she went home in despair and killed herself, leaving
a pathetic little letter to the Minister stating that
she hoped that the sacrifice of her life might in some
way help to cleanse her country from its disgrace.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:488px" src="images/img366.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LOOKERS-ON</p></div>

<p>Patriotism is a strong trait in the character of the
Japanese; but perhaps their imagination and their
love of Nature are even stronger, and at all events
will cause them to bound forward and become a first-rate
power. This universal force of the imagination
is a quality that no other nation possesses, and it is
a quality that will cause her, not so very many
years hence, to dominate the world. All the Japanese
possess imagination, from the highest to the lowest;
it is shown in every action and detail of their daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
life. There is no one of them, even to the poorest
coolie, who has not some little collection of exquisite
works of the art that he loves. Your jinricksha man,
if you were ever allowed the privilege of visiting his
house, would in all probability be able to show you
one or two choice specimens, either in china or in
bronze, of his household gods. And so strongly is
the love of Nature impressed within him that he
cannot pass a beautiful scene&mdash;a hillside of blossom,
or a sunset&mdash;without stopping his ricksha to allow
you also the privilege of enjoying it. Often when
taking a drive in the country he will suddenly stop
in front of some delightful scene, put down your
ricksha, and, taking from his kimono sleeve a little
roll of rice, wrapped in a dainty bamboo leaf, will
sit down and begin to eat it with his chopsticks,
continuing to gaze at the scene, every now and
then looking up at you for sympathy. If you are
an artist, and will look at the scene intelligently and
appreciatively, this little ricksha man will be your
slave for life and will do anything for you.</p>

<p>Men are esteemed in Japan in proportion to their
artistic capabilities, and not for their banking accounts.
It is in this quality of imagination that we Britishers
are deficient. Our lack of imagination will be the cause
of the decline of our Empire, if it does decline.</p>

<p>Then, the Japanese are a polite people. If you
give a present to some little child, a mite strapped
to the back of a sister that is scarcely bigger than
itself, you are almost sure to find that little child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
waiting for you on your return to your hotel with
some small trifle to offer you; and this little one
will bow to you from its rather awkward position
with all the grace imaginable. Two coolies sweeping
the roads, when meeting for the first time in the
day, will lay down their brooms and salute each
other before passing on their way to work.</p>

<p>I have had many experiences, when sketching the
streets of Japan, of the people&rsquo;s politeness. A policeman
becoming interested in my work would help to
keep clear a space in the road, and never dream of
overlooking my work or of embarrassing me in any
way. In one street of a village he actually had the
traffic turned down another way, so as not to interfere
with my sketching. Fancy a policeman in England
diverting the traffic simply because an artist wanted
to sketch a meat shop!</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable illustrations of the
native politeness that I have ever witnessed was in
Tokio. A man pulling along a cart loaded high up
with boughs of trees chanced to catch the roof of a
coolie&rsquo;s house in one of his pieces of timber, tearing
away a large portion of it (for a roof is a very slim
affair in Japan). The owner of the house rushed out
thoroughly upset, and began to expostulate, and to
explain how very distressing it was to have one&rsquo;s
roof torn off in this manner. No doubt if he had
been a Britisher he would have used quaint language;
but there are no &ldquo;swear words&rdquo; in the Japanese
language&mdash;they are too polite a people. The abused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
one stood calmly, with arms folded, listening to the
harangue, and saying nothing. Only, when the enraged
man had finished, he pointed to the towel which in his
haste the coolie had forgotten to take off his head. At
once the coolie realised the enormity of his offence.
Both hands flew to the towel, and tore it off in confusion,
the coolie bowing to the ground and offering
humble apologies for having presumed to appear
without uncovering his head. For in Japan one must
always uncover, whether to a sweep or to a Mikado.
The two parted the best of friends. One had been
impolite enough to forget to uncover; the other had
torn away a roof. The rudeness of the one balanced
the injury of the other. Thus are offences weighed in
Japan.</p>
